## Responsibility

The mobile-first React UI. Ships as static assets and dials an engine host over the wire. Renders `pi`'s
event stream as a chat-centric, multi-session IDE shell.

## Boundary

- **Owns:** the browser UI — client-local navigation and workbench state, transport client, store, panels, the responsive shell, branding tokens.
- **Public surface:** the built static bundle (`dist/`) — a deployable artifact that dials a host.
- **Allowed deps:** `@thinkrail/contracts` (types + WS constants) ONLY; React / Zustand / Vite / etc.
- **Deployment obligation:** one built client serves every launcher and future deployment. Endpoint selection
  belongs to the transport bootstrap; panels, stores, and feature flows never branch on `cli`, `desktop`, or
  a deployment name.
- **Forbidden:** importing `server` / `shared` / any `pi` package (value or type). Kept clean by type-only
  imports + `verbatimModuleSyntax` (a `dist/` build shows no provider SDK / `node:fs`).

## Internal modules

Each is a bounded sub-module; `navigation`/`transport`/`store`/`updates`/`prompt`/`resources`/`lib` expose an `index.ts` **barrel** (their only public
surface). `panels`/`components/ui`/`chat` are imported **per-file by design** — barreling them would pull
the lazily-loaded Monaco/shiki/xterm chunks into the eager bundle and break the shadcn per-primitive
convention; their boundary is held by convention + spec. Sibling edges live here, not in the leaves.

| module | owns | barrel | spec |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `navigation` | backend-relative location model + fragment driver/validated restore | yes | [navigation/SPEC.md](src/navigation/SPEC.md) |
| `transport` | the WS client + its singleton/store wiring | yes | [transport/SPEC.md](src/transport/SPEC.md) |
| `store` | Zustand: domain projections, one local workbench frame, per-workspace views/attention, chat runtimes | yes | [store/SPEC.md](src/store/SPEC.md) |
| `panels` | layout-agnostic, store-driven feature views | no | [panels/SPEC.md](src/panels/SPEC.md) |
| `resources` | resource descriptors, renderer resolution, and renderer-agnostic review surface types | yes | [resources/SPEC.md](src/resources/SPEC.md) |
| `chat` | pi conversation UI primitives: content-block renderers + the tool-renderer registry | no | [chat/SPEC.md](src/chat/SPEC.md) |
| `prompt` | lifecycle-neutral slash completion + prompt-template slot editing | yes | [prompt/SPEC.md](src/prompt/SPEC.md) |
| `auth` | in-app provider login: the presentational OAuth dialog + its client-side state reducer | yes | [auth/SPEC.md](src/auth/SPEC.md) |
| `shell` | responsive composition + frontend-local workbench ownership (bounded `layout/` and `layoutState/` children) | no | [shell/SPEC.md](src/shell/SPEC.md) |
| `updates` | optional native/host update shell hook and props-driven controls | yes | [updates/SPEC.md](src/updates/SPEC.md) |
| `components` | dependency-light shared React primitives: error isolation, status icons, custom icons, quiet scroll frames (contains `ui/`) | no | [components/SPEC.md](src/components/SPEC.md) |
| `components/ui` | shadcn primitives, themed with our tokens | no | [components/ui/SPEC.md](src/components/ui/SPEC.md) |
| `themes` | validated single-file manifests, bundled catalog + atomic token application | yes | [themes/SPEC.md](src/themes/SPEC.md) |
| `lib` | `cn()` + the shared UI/path/array primitives + highlighting | yes | [lib/SPEC.md](src/lib/SPEC.md) |

Leaf utilities without their own spec: `constants/` (branding), `clientPreferences.ts` (feature-neutral
access to the optional native stable string adapter), and `styles/` — which holds the three
design-system SOURCES (`typography.json`, `colors.json`, `spacing.json`), their generated CSS, and the
structural token contract; per-theme palettes belong to `themes`. Each system is specced beside its source:
[TYPOGRAPHY.md](src/styles/TYPOGRAPHY.md), [COLOR.md](src/styles/COLOR.md) and [SPACING.md](src/styles/SPACING.md).
Outside `src/`, **[`scripts/`](scripts/SPEC.md)** is the build-time generator module — it runs under Bun,
never ships, and turns those three JSON sources into `styles/generated/` (plus the vendored provider
marks into `chat/generated/`).
`index.html` names the product and links the local, symbol-only SVG favicon derived from the same
ThinkRail artwork as the shell logo (compact enough for browser-tab sizes and light/dark browser chrome).
`main.tsx` is the entry/composition root — it synchronously builds the bundled theme catalog, resolves and
applies the versioned first-paint theme-preference hint (including the current system color scheme) pre-React,
initializes transport + client-local navigation, then wraps `<Shell />` in
`components/ErrorBoundary` as the last-resort boundary (a crash escaping every region shows a reload
screen, not a blank root) plus the app's single `TooltipProvider`.

**React is one exact, matching `react` + `react-dom` 19.3 canary pin until the first stable release carrying
upstream fix #34803.** React 19.2's development Performance Tracks retained every
`performance.measure()` record; Pi-rate chat renders grew a Vite tab past 10 GB while the JS heap stayed
flat, then Chrome killed the renderer and Vite reported the dead socket as `EPIPE` / `ECONNRESET` (React
#34770). The selected canary contains React's own `clearMeasures` fix; ThinkRail deliberately carries no
second measure-reaping policy. Because prereleases do not satisfy dependencies' stable React peer ranges,
the root package-manager overrides resolve both runtime packages through their catalog entries; `check:deps`
reads `bun.lock` and rejects any second `react` or `react-dom` version. Every React move upgrades both
packages together and repeats the mounted-chat memory stress probe before this temporary canary pin can
return to stable.

**The React Compiler is on for every `apps/web` bundle** (`vite.config.ts`: `@rolldown/plugin-babel` running
`@vitejs/plugin-react`'s `reactCompilerPreset()` over dev and build). Three devDependencies live in this
manifest only, and the `@babel/core` 7.x pin is load-bearing: `babel-plugin-react-compiler` 1.0.0 mis-lowers
destructuring defaults under Babel 8 and silently drops those functions from compilation. Bailouts never
fail the build — a function the compiler cannot prove safe is skipped whole, not miscompiled — so check it
ran: a production build's `dist/assets/*.js` carries `react.memo_cache_sentinel` in the hundreds (React's own
runtime accounts for three). `bun test` transpiles without Vite, so only the browser E2E suite exercises
compiled output.

The shell, the workbench group views, `ChatView`, `Composer` and `useChatScroll` compile because they keep
these conventions:

- A latest-value ref (`xRef.current = value`) is written in a `useInsertionEffect`, never in render, and
  render never reads `ref.current`. Insertion effects run for the whole tree before any layout effect, so a
  child's layout effect that calls back into the parent (`react-resizable-panels`' `onLayout`, Virtuoso's
  geometry reads in `useChatScroll`) sees the current value. The effect only assigns refs: no state, no DOM.
- A hook hands refs back beside render values as a tuple (`useElementSize`), or the caller destructures them
  (`useCollapsibleRegion`, dnd-kit results): reading a render value off an object that carries a ref counts
  as a ref read.
- A ref that travels as a prop is named `*Ref` (`selectionEpochRef`) so handlers may mutate it.
- A closure that reads refs reaches a `useState` initialiser only through a hook
  (`useReadingBandController`), and a ref is never handed to a plain helper; the helper becomes a hook that
  owns it (`useSideResizeBinder`).
- A default parameter never reads a member expression (`caret = text.length`); resolve it in the body.
- A closure never applies `++`/`--` to a variable it captures; write `attempts += 1`.
- A `useMemo`/`useCallback` lists every dependency it reads, or the compiler cannot preserve it.
- A `useMemo` dependency the callback does not read is dropped, so a memo cannot reset on a key it ignores
  (`useMemo(() => new Map(), [key])` builds one map per mount). Reset through state keyed on the value instead
  (`ChatView`'s row-height estimate cache).
- Render never reads a value the compiler cannot see change — `matchMedia`, storage, `Date.now`, a module
  singleton. It arrives through `useSyncExternalStore` or state: `AppearanceSettings` subscribes with
  `onSystemAppearanceChange`, and relative-time labels take `now` from `components/useNow`.

Known bailouts include two hot paths: `useVirtualRows` runs on every `ChatView` render (each streamed delta)
and `PlanComposer` on every plan-pane keystroke. Shared hooks and resource surfaces also have bailouts;
compilation of the chat/shell hot paths does not imply coverage of every file/diff renderer.

- Ref access in render: `useVirtualRows` (reads the visible-anchor ref while adjusting state during render;
  state would cost a render per scroll), `useWorkspaceRead`, `useChatTodos`, `useOpenBranchReview`,
  `useBranchList`, `useTemplateCommandPicker`, `usePendingSelection`, `MonacoEditor`, `AskUserQuestionCard`,
  `useScrollViewState`, Pierre diff/file's `useThreadAnnotations`, `PierreDiffSurface`, `PierreFileSurface`,
  image diff's `ImageContent`, `ImageView`, `PdfView`, `usePdfDocument`.
- try/finally: `PlanPane` (also a throw inside try), `PlanComposer`, `ReviewPanel`, `SendButtonBase`,
  `NewWorkspaceDialog`, `SkillsDialog`, `TemplateEditorDialog`, `JetBrainsAiCard`, `ProvidersSettings`,
  `ModelsSettings`, `GithubSettings`, `LayoutSettings`, `ProjectSkillsNotice`, `StarterTemplatesOffer`.
- try without catch: `usePromptImages`, `LineWidthControl`.
- Throw inside try: `DiffPane`.
- Manual memo dependencies cannot be preserved: `CsvDiff`, `JsonDiff`, `NotebookDiffSurface`, `PdfDiff`.
- Other: `useLiveTabContent` (`??=`), `useAnalyticsConsent` (a callback that calls itself), `TemplateRow`
  (a conditional inside try/catch), `HistoryOverlay`'s `Highlight` (mutates a closure counter).

A new bailout is a regression unless it joins this list.

### Dependency graph

- `navigation` → `store`, `transport`, `contracts` (type-only); neither dependency imports it, and `main.tsx` initializes the integration
- `shell` → children `shell/layout` + `shell/layoutState`, `updates` (one optional-capability hook + props-driven Settings content and durable status affordance), `panels`, `chat` (app-integration render/hydration only), `store`, `transport` (domain hydration + endpoint identity), `contracts` (type-only), `components/ui`, `components` (`ErrorBoundary` around each mounted region + `QuietScrollArea` around shell-owned tool bodies), `constants`, `lib` (platform shortcut semantics), `themes` (the single owner of catalog/media resolution and atomic theme application, driven by the hydrated store preference or pre-hydration hint)
- `shell/layout` → `contracts` (`LayoutPreset` + `GitDiffScope` types only), `lib` (attention/id primitives), and React / `react-resizable-panels` / `@dnd-kit/core`; `shell/layoutState` → `shell/layout`, `store`, `transport` (browser endpoint identity + error normalization), `clientPreferences` (native-stable persistence), `contracts` (`LayoutPreset` type only), `lib`, and React. The parent injects store state and feature renderers, so the pure layout child has no feature-module runtime edge
- `updates` → `contracts` (native bridge + host notice types), `store` (host notice), `components/ui`, React, and Remix Icon; native snapshots remain shell-local
- `panels` → `resources`, `store`, `transport`, `components/ui`, `components` (`ErrorBoundary` for feature bodies + quiet scroll surfaces for panel-owned lists/xterm), `lib`, `contracts`, `constants` (`WelcomePanel`'s wordmark), `prompt` (`NewWorkspaceDialog` consumes the shared slash/template behavior), `chat` (`NewWorkspaceDialog` eagerly reuses `chat/ModelEffortPicker`+`useModelCatalog`+`useModelPreferences`, `ReviewSettings`/`ModelsSettings` the older `ModelSelector`+`ThinkingSelector`, and `ProvidersSettings` the `chat/modelPicker` connection-kind vocabulary — all shiki-free, so the eager import stays split-safe; `TemplatesSettings` reuses `chat/TemplateEditorDialog` for its New/Edit flows — see `panels/SPEC.md`'s `TemplatesSettings` paragraph), `auth` (`ProvidersSettings` mounts `auth/LoginDialog`), `themes` (`AppearanceSettings` consumes the live catalog; code surfaces consume generic theme variables/syntax mapping), `@shikijs/monaco` (the desktop file renderer's TextMate adapter), `@pierre/diffs` (all source diffs + phone code files), `diff` (engine-neutral mutation blocks, CSV row alignment, and notebook cell similarity), `jsondiffpatch` (structural JSON deltas with move detection), `react-virtuoso` (CSV rows), and `pdfjs-dist` (PDF canvas rendering)
- `chat` → `contracts` (pi message types, **type-only**), `components/ui`, `prompt` (shared slash/template behavior), `lib`, `clientPreferences`; `store` + `transport`
  (**app-integration files only** — the renderers stay store-free; see `chat/SPEC.md` for the current set)
- `prompt` → `contracts` (slash/template types only), `lib`, and React; it has no lifecycle integration dependency
- `auth` → `components/ui` (the dialog is store/transport-free — the panel integrates it; the state types need no imports)
- `store` → `transport` (**type-only** — `ConnectionStatus`), `chat` (**type-only** — `ChatTurn`/`ToolResultState`), `auth` (**type-only** — `LoginState`; the `foldLoginFrame` reducer lives in `store`, like `reduceExtUi`), `contracts` (domain + custom-preset types, never current-layout DTOs), `lib` (shared path/array primitives — a leaf, so no cycle), and `shell/layout` (**type-only** for web-local frame/view state)
- `transport` → `contracts`, `store` (welcome routing; the `store → transport` back-edge is type-only, so
  the runtime graph is acyclic), `lib` (plain-HTTP-safe random page identity)
- `components` (`ErrorBoundary`) → `lib` only (`shallowEqualArrays` for its reset keys — a leaf, so any region can still wrap in it); `components/ui` → `lib`
- `resources` → `contracts` (types only), `lib`; it owns no store, transport, shell, or renderer implementation
- `lib` → `themes` (the lazy highlighter uses the one generic CSS-variable Shiki registration) and React (the phone-viewport hook only)
- `themes` → `constants` (the branding storage prefix scopes the first-paint hint), `clientPreferences` (native-stable hint storage)
- leaves (`clientPreferences`, `constants`, `utils`, `styles`) → none internal

Rules: a panel never imports another panel sideways; nothing imports `shell` (it's the composition root).

`@pierre/diffs`, `diff`, `jsondiffpatch`, `react-virtuoso`, `pdfjs-dist`, and `@shikijs/monaco` are
exact-pinned runtime dependencies. `pdfjs-dist` and its `pdf.worker.min.mjs` worker URL are reached only from
the lazy PDF renderer chunks; neither belongs in the entry graph. Pierre, its Shiki
language/theme graph and worker entry, plus Monaco, its curated Shiki grammars and adapter, remain behind
resource-loader dynamic imports. Only lazy Pierre renderer modules mount the provider, and every mounted
surface acquires Pierre's module-singleton worker pool; an ordinary workspace therefore neither loads Pierre
nor initializes its pool. Renderer metadata and loaders are the only eager edge. A production build must
retain distinct Pierre diff, Pierre file, worker-pool, and Monaco chunks, with none of their implementation
code in the entry chunk.

The module set: `transport` / `store` / branded `shell` + its headless `shell/layout` child;
layout-agnostic Project/File/Specs/Changes/Review renderers; registry-dispatched resource bodies and lazy xterm terminal
bodies; the shared `prompt` behavior module; and the `chat` module (`ChatView`, content-block renderers, tool registry, and full Composer). The
workbench owns center and left/right/bottom auxiliary strips/groups around those bodies, never the panels
themselves.

## Styling & theming

- **Tailwind v4 utilities, mapped to the design tokens** (`src/index.css` `@theme inline`). Components
  use utilities for colour, spacing, borders and layout (`bg-container-header-bg`, `text-primary`,
  `border-border-default`,
  `px-12`) and a **generated semantic typography class** for type (`tr-text-ui`, `tr-title-dialog`,
  `tr-code-text`, …) — **never inline `style` objects except renderer-measured geometry, and never raw
  hex.** The bounded geometry exception covers values such as intrinsic media bounds, normalized overlays,
  zoom, swipe position, and portal placement; colour, spacing, and control skin remain token utilities.
  Responsive (`md:` …) and states (`hover:` / `focus-visible:`) come from Tailwind (inline styles can't
  express them, and the responsive shell needs them).
- **Chrome geometry lives in `index.css`, host geometry arrives as CSS custom properties.** Beside the
  generated colour/spacing layers, `index.css` maps the shell's structural rows (`--spacing-panel-header-row`,
  `--spacing-topbar-row` from `tokens.css`) and the two host-published window-chrome insets
  (`--spacing-window-chrome-inset-left|right: var(--window-chrome-inset-*, 0px)`), while the host also
  publishes `--window-chrome-drag-region`. It declares the only two non-typographic handwritten utilities,
  `window-drag` / `window-no-drag` (`-webkit-app-region` + `app-region`); `window-drag` is inert unless the
  host opts in. A host that removed its own caption buttons additionally installs the type-only
  `NativeWindowControlsBridge` from `contracts`, which the shell turns into HTML window controls. A native host may set these properties on `<html>`; the app never detects the host, it reads
  the properties with their `0px` fallbacks ([[submodule-web-shell]] owns the consumer, [[module-desktop]]
  the publisher).
- **The colour and type systems are this app's, not the monorepo's.** `apps/website` keeps its own
  hardcoded stylesheet on purpose — a static page with no theming has no use for a token layer, and
  reaching across apps would couple them for nothing.
- **A colour utility names a semantic role, never a palette entry** — `bg-container-elevated-bg`, not
  `bg-[var(--elevated)]`; and a tint is a token on the four-step alpha scale, not a `/40` modifier.
  `src/styles/COLOR.md` is the system; `src/styles/colorUsage.test.ts` is the adoption guard (Tailwind
  drops an unknown utility silently, so an unpublished token renders as nothing at all).
- **Ordinary radius and rhythm-spacing values come from their scales, never raw pixel lengths** — `rounded-[var(--radius-md)]`
  and `p-8` / `gap-12`, not `rounded-[7px]` or `py-[3px]`. Radius is the project t-shirt family
  (`--radius-xs/sm/md/lg` — a small primitive geometry capped at 8px: `sm` (4px) is the default corner,
  `md` (6px) the outer corner for surfaces nesting 4px children, `lg` (8px) the exception for large
  standalone elevated surfaces (dialogs, user-message bubbles)). Spacing is **one canonical numeric
  scale** — `0 / 2 / 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32 / 40 / 64` — where the step name *is* its pixel value, so
  `p-8` / `gap-12` / `py-4` resolve to exactly that many pixels; it is generated from a single JSON source
  (`src/styles/spacing.json` → `src/styles/generated/spacing.css`), so each canonical length is written
  once in the JSON rather than re-declared at call sites.
  `src/styles/SPACING.md` (`web-spacing`) is the authoritative system; `src/styles/spacingUsage.test.ts`
  is that adoption guard, and it exists because this class of drift is **invisible**: unlike a colour
  utility, an arbitrary length always renders, so an off-scale value looks correct in review and passes
  every other gate. Lengths that are not scale steps at all — `max-w-[78ch]`, `w-[320px]`,
  `max-h-[40vh]`, a measured `pl-[calc(…)]` indent — stay allowed; they are layout constraints, not rhythm.
- **Icons are `@remixicon/react` (Remix Icon) glyphs sized by UI *context*, not location, on the
  Tailwind `size-*` scale** — imported by name, no `<Icon>` wrapper and no `size=` prop, and never a
  container added just to resize a glyph. Remix glyphs are `fill="currentColor"`, so the semantic
  `text-*` utilities colour them. **Style is state-driven: the `Line` (outline) variant is the
  default; the `Fill` (solid) variant marks the *active/selected* item** — the selected project &
  active workspace rows (`ProjectTree`), the active/main-spec node (`SpecsPanel`), the active file/dir
  row (`TreeRow`) and the active editor tab (`Workbench`) swap to `Ri…Fill`; everything else (buttons,
  chevrons, status, composer, chat, menus) stays `Ri…Line`. Icons with no Line/Fill pair
  (`RiParagraph`/`RiDraggable`/`RiLinkM`/`RiListCheck3`) render their single style in both states.
  **Project-custom glyphs** that Remix lacks live as SVGs in `public/custom-icons/` and render through
  the `CustomIcon` primitive (`components/CustomIcon`) — a `currentColor` CSS `mask-image` span, so they
  theme and swap Line/Fill by state exactly like Remix glyphs. The **Changes** tool uses the custom
  `file-diff` glyph; **Review** uses `RiDiscussLine`/`RiDiscussFill`.
  Three tiers: `size-12` (12px) for **chat-content** indicators (tool activity, plan/todo status,
  expand/collapse chat details — subordinate to chat text); `size-14` (14px) for **compact interface /
  navigation chrome** (left/right panels, panel & toolbar headers, tabs, the mobile switcher rail, menu
  items, standalone chrome icon-buttons); `size-16` (16px) for a **prominent dedicated icon-button
  surface** — the app-chrome Settings gear and the composer's bottom controls (Send + peers) — **and
  for every disclosure/expand chevron** (`ChevronDown/Right/Left/Up`), which are `size-16` in all
  contexts regardless of tier. The **icon↔text gap is `gap-4` (4px)** across all icon+label rows (nav
  rows, menu/command items, tabs). A **two-line** row (e.g. a
  workspace whose branch differs from its name) **top-aligns** the icon to the first line (`items-start`
  + `mt-2`) so the glyph hangs on its title, while a single-line row stays vertically centred
  (`items-center`, no nudge). Menu-item icons are centralized once in `components/ui/menu-styles.ts` (`menuItemClass`
  `[&_svg]:size-14` + `gap-4`).
- **`src/themes` is the theme contract and catalog; `src/styles/tokens.css` is structural.** A bundled
  theme is one strict, complete `*.theme.json` manifest: appearance/contrast metadata + semantic UI
  colors + all 16 ANSI colors + a semantic syntax palette. Selected-text foreground overrides are the
  only nullable color slots (`null` retains the consumer default). A build-time glob validates the set at
  bootstrap (our files — a bad one fails loudly), so adding a theme changes only that file — never
  contracts, a label map, CSS selectors, editor imports, tests, or specs — and appears after a rebuild.
  Manifests are self-contained (no inheritance), contain canonical color data only, and cannot alter
  layout/type/motion or inject CSS/code. The engine derives repetitive tints/effects and atomically
  writes the mapped custom properties before changing `[data-theme]`; `@theme inline` keeps every utility
  pointed at the live variables, so components remain unchanged. `tokens.css` retains the spacing basis,
  radii, motion and generic derived formulas — **no typography at all** (not a value and not an alias onto
  one; the `--font` / `--font-mono` / `--font-accent` / `--font-mono-size` / `--line-height` aliases are
  gone, because a second name for a value is what drifts) and no named theme blocks.
- The theme preference is **server-synced**: `AppConfig.theme` remains the host-owned opaque fixed choice,
  while closed `themeMode` and optional opaque `systemThemePair` opt into per-client system matching. Each
  client resolves the pair against its own `prefers-color-scheme`; operating-system changes are local DOM
  effects and never config writes, so two clients may simultaneously render different appearances. Fixed
  Dark remains the default for both new and legacy config. `settings.update` converges through
  `settings.changed`; a theme-only legacy mutation exits system mode. An unavailable system slot falls back
  deterministically within the required appearance without destructively rewriting the requested value.
  The versioned pre-React hint caches the preference, not the last effective id, using the injected stable
  native preference adapter when present and localStorage otherwise. Themes ship with the app: one is added
  only via a source PR, and runtime registration/extension loading is deliberately not designed.
- **Every code surface is catalog-agnostic.** xterm and Monaco rebuild from generic variables after the
  atomic `[data-theme]` signal, including an optional selected-text foreground. Monaco chooses
  `vs`/`vs-dark` or the corresponding high-contrast base from manifest appearance/contrast metadata,
  never a theme id. Shiki uses one code-owned semantic CSS-variable TextMate map: chat consumes its live
  references, while Monaco resolves that same map to hex for `@shikijs/monaco`; Pierre's separate
  `thinkrail` registration also emits live variable references. None needs a per-theme import or selector,
  and only strict Monaco re-resolves after a swap. Pierre's own inherited diff variables carry semantic feedback
  and canvas colours into its Shadow DOM. Mermaid re-derives from the same variables. Reads for
  strict consumers still pass through `lib.cssColorToHex`. Data-driven tests enforce the existing
  contrast floor (body/muted ≥ 4.5:1 and hint ≥ 3:1 on the primary declared surfaces) for every discovered
  manifest.
- Token names that collide with a Tailwind namespace (`--radius-*`) are used as token arbitrary values
  (`rounded-[var(--radius-md)]`), not `@theme` mappings.
- **Typography comes from `styles/typography.json` via generated semantic classes — nothing else.**
  `styles/generated/typography.css` (committed, regenerated by `bun run typography:generate`, drift-gated
  by `typography:check`) emits the primitive `--tr-*` custom properties, the `<body>` base, and one class
  per semantic style: `tr-brand-*`, `tr-heading-*`, `tr-title-*`, `tr-text-*`, `tr-code-*` plus one
  `tr-prose-<surface>` system per markdown surface (`tr-prose-chat`, `tr-prose-doc` — same element set,
  different scale, because a chat bubble and a rendered document need different heading ladders). A call
  site names exactly one class and adds its own **colour**; `italic` and `leading-*` are the only Tailwind
  utilities that may override a semantic style (the classes are emitted in `@layer components`, so a
  utility wins the single property it names, while the `<body>` base in `@layer base` loses to all of them).
- **Handwritten typography utilities must not be introduced.** No new `@utility` rule may set
  `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `line-height`, `letter-spacing` or `text-transform`, and no
  component may compose them — add a semantic style to `typography.json` instead. The former
  `text-mono` / `text-base-mono` / `text-brand` / `text-eyebrow` utilities and the
  `--text-xs|sm|base|md|lg` mappings are all gone; a generated class replaces each. `index.css` maps
  exactly two typography names — `--font-sans` / `--font-mono`, so Tailwind's *preflight* defaults for
  `html` and `code`/`pre` come from the JSON too; the `font-sans` / `font-mono` utilities that enables are
  banned at call sites. `styles/typographyUsage.test.ts` enforces all of it, including that a `tr-`
  class a component names is one the generator actually emits (an unknown class is dropped silently by
  Tailwind, so the element renders unstyled while the class list claims otherwise).
- **A primitive font family may only be named for a documented third-party integration.** Monaco
  (`panels/monacoSetup.ts`) reads the code family, `s11`, and the default line-height; Pierre receives the
  same primitives through the `.pierre-code-surface` custom-property bridge in `index.css`; xterm
  (`panels/TerminalInstance.tsx`) reads the code family + `s13` and owns its row height; mermaid
  (`chat/tools/visualize/mermaid.ts`) reads the code family. These third-party integrations are the exhaustive
  allowlist in `styles/typographyUsage.test.ts`. Everywhere else a class is required, and
  `<pre>` / `<code>` must carry one even inside a container that has one: preflight targets those elements
  directly, and a directly-matching rule beats an inherited family. Note that the bare arbitrary value
  `font-[var(--font-mono)]` is ambiguous — Tailwind compiles it to an invalid `font-weight`, so it
  silently does nothing; the working form is `font-(family-name:--font-mono)`
  (`styles/fontClasses.test.ts` fails on the bare form).
- **Fonts ship inside the artifact.** `styles/generated/fonts.css` imports self-hosted variable faces
  (fontsource; Geist Variable + JetBrains Mono Variable, both with real italics — shared with
  `apps/website`, so their versions live in the root `workspaces.catalog`). Which packages those are is
  declared per family as `selfHosted` in `styles/typography.json`, so the stack and the bundled faces
  cannot drift; the imports are generated from it. Vite emits the woff2 files
  into `dist/assets`, and `apps/cli` embeds them. No font CDN — the host is local and often
  offline, and an external `<link>` also put first paint behind a third party and contacted it on every
  load despite the analytics opt-out. `e2e/fonts.spec.ts` pins both halves (no CDN request; the real
  faces present).
- **The typography system — `typography.json` as the single source of truth, the primitives and the
  semantic styles generated from them, the `<body>` base, the 370/400/500/600/800 weight policy,
  code-only mono, the two prose systems, and how to add or change a style — is specced in
  [src/styles/TYPOGRAPHY.md](src/styles/TYPOGRAPHY.md)** (`web-typography`); check changes against it. The
  generator that turns it into CSS is [scripts/SPEC.md](scripts/SPEC.md).
- **Icons: `@remixicon/react` (Line default, Fill when active/selected). Components: shadcn/ui** (Radix primitives), copy-in under `src/components/ui/`
  and themed with our token utilities (`cn()` in `src/lib/utils.ts`) — never shadcn's default oklch
  palette. Use these for accessible menus / dialogs / tooltips; icon-only controls label themselves with
  `IconTooltip`, never native `title`.

## Get right

- **`apps/web` depends on `packages/contracts` only.** Never value-import `pi`; never import `server`/`shared`.
- Streaming invariant: `text_delta` / `thinking_delta` **APPEND**; `tool_execution_update.partialResult`
  **REPLACE**. Attempt-level `agent_end` never means idle; automatic work ends only at `agent_settled`.
- Panels stay arrangement-agnostic so the mobile shell is an additive layer, not a rewrite.
- **Every host HTTP route the app composes is proxied by the Vite dev server.** The app reaches the host
  over `/ws` and over the two byte routes `/files` and `/blob` (images, PDFs, notebooks, markdown-relative
  images), always composed through one function (`panels/resourcePane.resourceBytesUrl`) on the
  transport's HTTP origin. Under `bun run dev` that origin is Vite, and a route Vite does not proxy
  answers the SPA `index.html` with status 200 — an `<img>` shows nothing and a PDF fetch "succeeds" with
  HTML, while the host-served build and the e2e suite stay green. `vite.config.ts` therefore proxies
  `/files` and `/blob` beside `/ws`, and `devProxy.test.ts` pins the list to the composer's constants.

## Later

The mobile single-view shell and PWA packaging (installable, offline shell) ride on this split without
touching panels or store.
