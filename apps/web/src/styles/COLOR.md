# Colour system

Colour arrives in **two layers**, and a component may only ever name the second one.

```
themes/bundled/*.theme.json    the PALETTE — one file per theme, the only place a hex lives
styles/colors.json             the SEMANTIC layer — what each palette entry is FOR (one file)
styles/colors.schema.json      the editor-facing contract for it
scripts/colors.ts              load / validate / render — the only place a derivation is written
scripts/generate-colors.ts     writes the output; `--check` fails when it is stale
styles/generated/colors.css    GENERATED: the roles, the `@theme inline` map, the effect blocks
themes/runtime.ts              writes the active manifest onto the document root
styles/colorUsage.test.ts      the adoption guard
```

**No colour is written twice.** A role's derivation lives in `colors.json` and nowhere else — not in
`tokens.css` (structure only), not in `index.css` (no `--color-*` at all), not in `runtime.ts` (which
now derives variable names rather than tabulating them). Editing the generated file fails
`bun run colors:check`, which runs in pre-commit and in `apps/web`'s build.

**Variable names are derived, not chosen.** A manifest key writes to its kebab-cased name —
`borderStrong` → `--border-strong`, `editorSelection` → `--editor-selection`. `colors.json` and
`runtime.ts` apply the same rule independently, so a role's `from` and the variable it reads cannot
disagree. There is no lookup table to keep in step, and no more names like `--blue` for `info`.

A **palette entry** answers *which colour* (`--warning`, `--elevated`, `--hint`). A **semantic token**
answers *what for* (`feedback-warning`, `container-elevated-bg`, `text-muted`). Components name roles;
the palette is internal.

```tsx
<div className="bg-container-elevated-bg text-text-muted border-border-default" />  // yes
<div className="bg-[var(--elevated)] text-hint border-border2" />                   // no
```

## Why the split

A theme changes *which* colour a role resolves to without touching a single component, and a role can be
re-pointed once instead of at 160 call sites. It also makes the failure mode visible: `bg-elevated` is
not a Tailwind utility any more, and Tailwind **drops an unknown utility silently** — the element renders
unstyled while its class list claims otherwise. `colorUsage.test.ts` exists because that shipped once.

## The tokens

Declared in `colors.json`, published as utilities by the generator. Every one is used; a token with no
call site is deleted, and so is an alias that can never differ from its neighbour (`border-strong` that
equals `border-default` is not a second weight, it is a second name).

| family | tokens | notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Text | `text-default` · `text-muted` · `text-subtle` · `text-disabled` · `text-on-primary` | `text-subtle` (from the `hint` palette key) is the secondary-metadata tier (branch lines, spec role labels); `text-disabled` (the default `text` colour @ 60% — a disabled element inherits its enabled semantic colour, dimmed at the token level) is reserved for genuinely disabled UI text (e.g. the Settings "Soon" item) |
| Container | `container-workspace-bg` · `container-sidebar-bg` · `container-terminal-bg` · `container-header-bg` · `container-content-bg` · `container-elevated-bg` | **The opened-document canvas is `workspace`, not `content`**: the Monaco desktop file editor, Pierre phone file, and markdown/spec preview sit on the same surface as the chat column and tab strip, so a document reads as part of the workspace. `content` is the **recessed diff canvas** — Pierre source diffs, rendered diffs, Shiki code blocks, and the Center Workbench backdrop behind them. `terminal` is a terminal body + xterm canvas (currently sourced from the same palette key as `sidebar`); `elevated` is every raised surface |
| Control | `control-bg` · `control-bg-hovered` · `control-bg-selected` · `control-primary-bg` · `control-primary-bg-hovered` · `control-primary-text` · `control-border-default` · `control-border-active` · `control-disabled-bg` · `control-disabled-text` · `control-disabled-border` · `control-primary-disabled-bg` · `control-primary-disabled-text` | The three `control-primary-*` tokens are the primary button/control, and they are **per-theme derivations like every other role** — `control-primary-bg` (from `accent`) fill, `control-primary-bg-hovered` (from `accentHover`) hover fill, `control-primary-text` (from `onAccent`) label. `accentHover` is the accent's **hover step**, its own manifest key so a theme owns that step: a primary button hovers to `control-primary-bg-hovered` (a colour token), never `hover:opacity-*`. Because the fill comes from `accent`, `bg-control-primary-bg` and `bg-primary` are the same colour by construction — a primary button can never drift from the theme's accent. `control-bg-hovered` is pointer hover only; `control-bg-selected` is the persistent selected/open/active/highlight fill (currently the same palette source). `control-border-default` is the resting form-control border; `control-border-active` (from `borderStrong`) is the **stronger neutral** border of an *active* control — pressed/`active:` buttons, an open selector (`data-[open=true]`), and a focused text input/textarea. It is the border only: the accent focus **ring** stays as the focus indicator (so accent = focus, neutral-strong = active). Never on inactive/default controls, nor on selected nav rows, tabs, or static surfaces. **Disabled is a first-class control state**, not an opacity utility: **a disabled element inherits the same semantic colour it uses when enabled, resolved at the `strong` (60%) alpha step** — derived at the token level so background, text, icon and border keep explicit ownership and nested content is never dimmed. So the disabled roles are the enabled ones @ 60%: `control-disabled-bg` (from `input`, i.e. `control-bg`), `control-disabled-text` (from `text`, i.e. `text-default`), `control-disabled-border` (from `border`, i.e. `control-border-default`), and the primary pair `control-primary-disabled-bg` (from `accent`, i.e. `control-primary-bg`) + `control-primary-disabled-text` (from `onAccent`, i.e. `control-primary-text`). There are **no** dedicated `disabled` / `primaryDisabled` / `onPrimaryDisabled` palette keys — a disabled state never carries a colour of its own. Text/icon-only controls take just `control-disabled-text`; non-control disabled text stays on `text-disabled`. Do **not** use `disabled:opacity-*` on a component (it dims nested content and bypasses token ownership). **One documented exception**: the composer's send pill is a primary control that is *inert* most of the time (empty draft), and a 60% accent block there pulls the eye to a control that cannot act — so it rests on `control-bg-selected` + `control-disabled-text` and the switch to the full accent fill is the "ready" signal (`chat/SPEC.md`, *Composer trailing controls*). Any other disabled primary control keeps the 60% pair |
| Border | `border-default` · `border-muted` | |
| Primary | `primary` + `primary-subtle` · `-soft` · `-muted`, `on-primary-soft` | |
| Feedback | `feedback-{info,success,warning,error}` + the `-subtle` / `-muted` steps in use | a solid border is the solid colour, so there is no `-border` tier |
| Chat bubble | `bubble-user-bg` · `bubble-user-border` | tinted from the manifest's own `bubbleAccent`, which every bundled theme currently ships **equal to its `accent`** — the user bubble wears the brand colour. The separate key is the knob (per `themes/SPEC.md`): a theme that wants the bubble to read as "you" rather than "the product" re-points it without touching a component |
| Effects | `overlay` · `sunken` | written per light/dark by the theme engine |
| Strict-consumer editor roles | `editor-selection-bg` · `editor-selection-text` · `editor-selection-highlight-bg` · `editor-find-match-bg` · `widget-shadow` | `publish: false`; Monaco/xterm read them directly and no Tailwind utility is emitted |
| Media | `media-checker-tile` | `publish: false`; the transparency checkerboard tile that `index.css`'s `.media-backdrop` paints behind every image and vector preview, derived from `text` at the `soft` (20%) step so it is light-on-dark in a dark theme and the conventional `#ccc`-on-white in a light one — a dark logo on a transparent PNG must never read as "no image" |

There is no `text-strong` and no `text-link` utility: they duplicate other tokens, and `--text-link`
exists as a variable for `global.css`'s bare-anchor fallback alone. That fallback lives in the CSS base
layer so an explicit semantic text utility on a link-shaped control always wins the cascade.

## Transparency: one form only

**A tint is a token, mixed `in srgb`, on the alpha scale.**

```
subtle 10%   ·   wash 12%   ·   soft 20%   ·   muted 40%   ·   strong 60%
```

`wash` (12%) is the feedback-surface fill step (`feedback-*-subtle`), kept one notch above `subtle`
(10%) so `primary-subtle` and `bubble-user-bg` stay at 10% while feedback backgrounds read at 12%.

Tailwind's `/40` opacity modifier is **not used on colour utilities**. It mixes `in oklab`, so the same
nominal percentage rendered differently depending on whether it came from a class or a token — and the
numbers drifted (10, 12, 15, 16, 25, 30, 35 and 50 were all live at once). A new tint is a new token on
the scale, never a new number in a class name.

## Non-CSS consumers

Monaco, Pierre, xterm, mermaid and Shiki cannot wear a class for their painted internals. Monaco, xterm,
and mermaid read tokens through `getComputedStyle` and rebuild after the `[data-theme]` swap; Monaco now
has only `EDITOR_THEME` and paints desktop files on `container-workspace-bg`. Pierre's open Shadow DOM
inherits one `.pierre-code-surface` custom-property bridge: its CSS-variable Shiki theme maps
`--diffs-token-*` to the existing `--code-*` syntax roles, while `--diffs-bg*`, number foregrounds, and
addition/deletion bases map to the workspace/content canvas, muted text, and feedback success/error roles.
Those values remain live variable references, so Pierre needs neither a per-theme registration nor a
re-highlight after a swap. Monaco and chat share the single `THINKRAIL_SHIKI_THEME` TextMate definition;
chat keeps its live CSS-variable form, while Monaco resolves the same variables to hex for its strict theme
API. All consumers therefore name the same semantic tokens everything else does, with one name per value.
The roles these consumers *share* with components (`--container-*-bg`, `--text-muted`) stay published and
mapped in `@theme inline`; the ones **only** they read (`--editor-selection-*`,
`--editor-find-match-bg`, `--widget-shadow`, and the stylesheet-only `--media-checker-tile`) are
`publish: false` and unmapped — a utility nothing can use is dead weight. Values that strict JS consumers
need reach them canonicalised to hex via `cssColorToHex` (`lib/utils.ts`), because the built CSS is minified
and Monaco/xterm accept hex only.

**What they do NOT cover, deliberately.** Each of these libraries paints far more than we hand it, and
the remainder comes from its own built-in palette:

| consumer | we set | the rest comes from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Monaco | desktop file canvas/foreground/gutter; active + inactive line numbers; cursor + both selection colours; current-line fill/border; indent guides; bracket match + six bracket-pair colours; word/selection/find highlights; sticky-scroll canvas/shadow; fold/whitespace paint; editor + hover widgets; menu, quick-input and input surfaces/states; focus border; widget/scrollbar shadows + slider states; every TextMate syntax rule | `vs` / `vs-dark` / `hc-black` / `hc-light` via `inherit: true` — suggest/peek/debug, minimap and other unlisted specialist surfaces |
| Pierre | file/diff canvas and gutter, foreground/line numbers/selection, syntax variables, success additions, error deletions, separator/annotation surfaces, code family/size | Pierre core layout/effects for properties not bridged; no `@pierre/theme` preset is applied |
| xterm | background, foreground, cursor, both selection colours, all 16 ANSI | xterm defaults for `cursorAccent` and `selectionInactiveBackground` |
| mermaid | the `themeVariables` map in `chat/tools/visualize/mermaid.ts` | mermaid's `base` theme for anything absent from that map |

This is a bounded, accepted gap, not an oversight. Monaco alone exposes ~200 colour keys; enumerating
them would be a large and brittle surface, and the base is chosen from the manifest's appearance and
contrast metadata, so it is never wildly wrong. If a theme ever looks off in one of these widgets, the
fix is to add that specific key — not to adopt the whole surface.

## Adding or changing a colour

Every case is a JSON edit followed by `bun run colors:generate`.

1. **A theme should look different** → edit `themes/bundled/<theme>.theme.json`. Nothing else changes,
   and no regeneration is needed: manifests are read at runtime.
2. **A role should point somewhere else** → change its `from` in `colors.json`.
3. **A new role** → add it to `roles` with `from`, an optional `alpha` step, and `publish`
   (`true` → a Tailwind utility; `false` → read directly by Monaco/xterm/mermaid/`global.css`).
4. **A new tint** → an `alpha` step from `scale`, never a `/N` at the call site. If the step itself is
   new, add it to `scale` — that is a design decision, and it is made once.
5. **A role two themes must be able to differ on** → it needs its own manifest key. Add it to
   `THEME_COLOR_KEYS` and `theme.schema.json`, and to all six manifests, then point a role at it. The
   generator refuses to run while a role names a key that does not exist, or a key no role reads.

Never: a raw hex or `rgb()` in a component, an inline `style` object, a `bg-[var(--palette-entry)]`
escape hatch, or a second name for a value that already has one.

## What is pinned by tests

`styles/colorUsage.test.ts` fails when:

- a colour utility names a token that `@theme inline` does not publish (the silent-drop bug);
- a component contains a raw hex, `rgb()` or `hsl()`;
- a component reaches a palette entry through `bg-[var(--…)]`;
- a `/N` opacity modifier appears on a colour utility;
- a declared token has no call site, or a published utility has no token;
- the committed generated files do not match what `colors.json` renders.

`themes/schema.test.ts` additionally pins the **contrast floors**, and those deserve stating here
because two of the lines are our judgement rather than the standard's:

- on every RESTING surface (`background`, `content`, `sidebar`, `header`, `elevated`, `input`) text
  meets WCAG AA in full — 4.5 for body and the `text-muted` tier;
- the deliberately quiet `text-subtle` / `hint` tier remains visible at **3.0** on every resting surface;
- on the transient HOVER surface the floor is **3.0**, not 4.5;
- the `hover` fill — the palette source of `control-bg-hovered` / `control-bg-selected` — stays
  **distinguishable from every resting surface**: ≥ **1.15** against all six. No canvas is exempt:
  interactive fills reach each of them (the content canvas hosts PlanPane's rows and the workbench
  backdrop's controls; `input` is the resting fill hovered controls swap away from).

WCAG has no "transient state" allowance, so the hover tier is a line we drew deliberately. These themes
lift the row background toward the text colour on hover, and holding that to 4.5 would have forced a
theme's signature accent toward a washed-out tint just to survive the hovered row. 3.0 keeps hovered
text comfortably visible while leaving the themes recognisable.
Revisit it if strict AA across every state ever becomes a requirement.

The distinguishability floor is equally ours: WCAG has no adjacent-fill metric at all. It exists
because High Contrast Light shipped `hover` at 1.05:1 against its own sidebar — selected
project/workspace rows were indistinguishable from the panel — while every legibility check stayed
green; review of that fix then found Light shipping `hover == content` outright, so PlanPane's
hovered rows vanished the same way. 1.15 is the line that separates a visible fill from an invisible
one; every bundled theme clears it on all six surfaces (the weakest live pair is Light's
hover-on-content at 1.165).

`themes/runtime.test.ts` pins application; `themes/shiki.test.ts` pins the syntax-variable map. See [`themes/SPEC.md`](../themes/SPEC.md) for the manifest itself and
[TYPOGRAPHY.md](./TYPOGRAPHY.md) for the parallel type system.

## Scope: this app only

`apps/website` — the public landing page — has its own stylesheet with its own hardcoded colours and
fonts, and shares nothing with this system. That is deliberate: it is a static marketing page on GitHub
Pages with no theme switching, no runtime, and no reason to carry a token layer. Do not "fix" it by
importing from here; if it ever needs to match the app, the move is to extract a small shared token
package, not to reach across apps.
