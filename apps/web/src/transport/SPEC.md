## Responsibility

The single WebSocket client to the host, its app-wide singleton, and the ordered delivery boundary that
batches high-frequency Pi events without allowing later wire messages to overtake them.

## Boundary

- **Owns:** `transport.ts` (`WsTransport`: id-correlated `request` — replies time out after 60s unless the
  caller raises `timeoutMs`, which a request the host answers *only once a human has* must do (an open
  folder dialog: a fired timeout also drops the reply that follows it) —, the **`?client=` page identity** and
  **`?protocol=` current wire version** it appends to the socket URL (the identity is minted lazily and *not*
  via the secure-context-only `crypto.randomUUID`, so a plain-http remote origin still boots; it spans
  reconnects but not reloads, correlating replayed requests and terminal stream routing while host-owned PTY
  tabs/shells survive and a reloaded page takes them over by durable `tabKey`; the version lets a newer host
  avoid claiming an addressed feature for an independently shipped older client that cannot render it), **reconnect-safe unresolved requests** — a
  frame that was in flight when its socket died returns to the queue and is replayed under the same request id,
  while the host deduplicates `(clientKey, requestId)`, so an accepted mutation cannot become a false failure or
  execute twice —, the two frames that are this side's half of that bargain — **`{ ack: [id] }` receipts**
  (every response read is acknowledged, batched on a microtask; until one arrives the host must assume the reply
  died with the socket and keep it replayable) and the **`{ resume: [ids] }` reconciliation** sent on every
  (re)connect *before* the replays (the complete still-unresolved set, so the host releases everything else).
  Receipts are deliberately best-effort and never retransmitted — one can die in a socket buffer exactly like a
  response can, and the request it named is already gone from `pending`, so nothing would replay or re-ack it;
  `resume` repairs them all at once by restating the truth rather than confirming the confirmations —, channel
  `subscribe` with last-value replay for snapshots; append-only terminal data and the one-shot terminal
  exit/detach + session-creation/deletion + `provider.changed` invalidation + addressed `feedback.interview`
  channels, plus scoped `session.resourcesChanged` invalidations, are never cached or replayed to late
  subscribers. Resource metadata hydration belongs to the mounted chat integration, not replayed
  invalidation payloads. Reconnect/backoff;
  `inferUrl` defaults to
  same-origin; **`httpBase()`** derives the host's HTTP origin
  from the WS `url` — for building host HTTP URLs like the `/files/<workspaceId>/<path>` worktree-file
  endpoint the markdown viewer points relative `<img>`s at, targeting the same host the transport dials); `piEventBatcher.ts`
  (the browser-side bounded queue for consecutive `pi.event` frames: exact arrival order, no dropped events,
  one atomic delivery at roughly 30 Hz, a 128-event forced-flush ceiling, and `flush`/`dispose` lifecycle);
  `wireTransport.ts` (`initTransport`/
  `getTransport` singleton; routes `server.welcome`, **`host.updateAvailable`**, **`project.updated`**, `pi.event`, `pi.extensionUi`,
  **`session.created`**, **`session.deleted`**, **`provider.changed`**, addressed **`feedback.interview`**, **the
  `workspace.created`/`updated`/`removed` lifecycle trio, and `workspace.fsChanged`** into the store — and
  folds every connection transition through
  `setStatus`, whose connected generation gives active-workspace hydration a distinct trigger on every
  reconnect; the complete welcome (protocol + open/recent project views + optional config) via the atomic
  `installWelcomeSnapshot`, whose separate `welcomeGeneration` is the cold-navigation readiness edge; after
  every welcome it re-reads each project whose workspace list this surface already holds with
  `includeDiffStats: false`, generation-fencing the result and folding only already-known rows through
  `updateWorkspace`, so a pushed full workspace snapshot missed while disconnected (including a rename)
  cannot stay stale without misrepresenting this metadata repair as membership reconciliation;
  the full host-update lifecycle snapshot via `applyHostUpdate`, project snapshots via
  `applyProjectUpdated`, consecutive `pi.event` frames through the batcher into one
  `handlePiEvents(payloads)` store commit, `pi.extensionUi` via `applyExtUi(request)`,
  `workspace.created` via `addWorkspace(workspace)`, `workspace.updated` via `updateWorkspace(workspace)`,
  `workspace.removed` via `applyWorkspaceRemoved(projectId, id)`, `session.created` via `noteClosedChats`
  (peer-created domain state enters history only, never local placement), `session.deleted` via the idempotent
  `deleteChat(workspaceId, sessionId)` tombstone fold (an online fast path; because this event channel is
  deliberately not replayed, workbench hydration repairs any deletion missed while disconnected from the next
  authoritative `session.list`), `provider.changed` via the atomic store invalidation
  `noteProviderChanged()` plus a `model.list` re-read installed through the store's monotonic provider-version
  guard (the model-catalog hook uses the same guarded write for every list/refresh, so an older reply cannot
  restore a removed generation's models; provider settings observes the same version and re-reads
  `provider.status`), each valid `server.welcome` first clearing any popup projection left by a host restart,
  then `feedback.interview` via the idempotent `showInterviewPrompt()` (a surviving host claim re-delivers the
  addressed event immediately after welcome),
  `workspace.fsChanged` via `noteFsChanged(payload)`, and **`settings.changed`** via `applyConfig(config)` — the post-startup server-synced app config broadcast;
  welcome config lands in the atomic install above.

  **Session state hydrates on every supported welcome.** `session.stateList` is tokenized by connection
  generation and buffers `session.state` pushes until the complete snapshot returns, folds those full-record
  replacements over their snapshot rows in arrival order, then installs the resulting authoritative map once.
  That ordered snapshot-plus-buffer state resolves any deliberate chat activation recorded before a current
  state row was available; later pushes cannot claim it. Current-generation failures retain the previous map and
  pending activation while retrying with capped backoff; overflowing the
  bounded push buffer restarts the complete read instead of growing without limit, while stale-generation
  outcomes discard their buffers. Pending dialog records replay their exact request, and adding/opening a
  workspace restarts the generation-guarded complete read so pre-existing disk sessions are included.
  Unsupported hosts clear the map. The old `session.activityList` tombstone
  is never requested by this client. Before `WsTransport` dispatches a state push, any queued Pi events flush
  synchronously, so the runtime transcript/render state precedes the host state that refers to it;
  connection-status transitions keep the same barrier.
  This dispatch barrier preserves cross-message order and the store's transcript-revision fence while still
  collapsing consecutive stream frames. All subscriptions happen once at init, never in component effects);
  `errorText.ts` (**`errorText(err, fallback?)`** — normalizes a rejected `request` (the host's error
  string / a timeout / a thrown non-Error) into a short, display-ready line for an error turn/notice);
  `requestError.ts` (**`RequestError`** + **`wsErrorCode(err)`** — a rejection that carries the host's named
  `WsResponse.errorCode`. A coded response rejects with a `RequestError`, everything else (timeout or an unnamed
  host error) with a plain `Error`, so *having* a code is exactly how a caller tells "this
  specific failure" from "the read failed"); `skillLoad.ts` (the one app-integration coordinator for session
  resource loads: single-flight `workspace.watchReady` per workspace; unless the watcher was already known
  ready, fold the conservative `skillChange: "unknown"` wildcard locally as a replay-safe fallback; capture
  the store tick only afterward. Its narrow `prewarmWorkspaceSkillLoad` entry lets a workspace navigator start
  that same preparation before selection without duplicating readiness/fallback policy; failures remain
  retryable by the eventual load. A prewarm preparation is flagged on the wire (`prewarm: true` — the host
  keeps prewarm-only watchers in a bounded, evictable pool) and **never becomes a real load's baseline**:
  the first real load always runs its own real-flagged preparation — answered instantly while the watcher is
  still warm, and re-creating/promoting it (fresh conservative nudge included) when it was evicted — so an
  evicted prewarm can never leave a session on a stale freshness baseline, while prewarms freely ride any
  in-flight preparation and a settled prewarm re-issues (re-warming an evicted watcher on project
  re-selection stays cheap). The wrappers then issue `session.create` / `session.getMessages` /
  `session.reloadResources`, so no call site can accidentally reverse readiness and baseline ordering. The
  `session.getMessages` wrapper also rejects unless the returned summary exactly matches both requested
  workspace and session, making that untrusted-response identity check one shared installation boundary rather
  than a caller convention).
- **Public surface (barrel):** `initTransport`, `getTransport`, `prewarmWorkspaceSkillLoad`, the three
  skill-load-safe session request wrappers, `errorText`, `RequestError`, `wsErrorCode`, `ConnectionStatus`,
  `TransportOptions`, `runHostUpdate`, `supportsHostUpdateRun`, `supportsPlanReview`,
  `supportsPlanSummaryGeneration`, `supportsChangeMutations`, `supportsRichAnchors`. `runHostUpdate` is the typed empty host action
  and `supportsHostUpdateRun` lets `Shell` inject it only for protocol v70+; `supportsPlanReview` is exported
  because a sibling panel (`PlanPane`) gates the plan-review UI on it — an older host serves no
  `todo.startReview`/`reviewAll`, so the client must not offer them; `supportsPlanSummaryGeneration` (v69) is
  exported because `chat/useChatTodos` gates the auto-summary `todo.generateSummary` request on it — an older
  host has no such method; `supportsChangeMutations` is exported because `DiffPane` must withhold every
  `change.*` affordance before that protocol lands; `supportsRichAnchors` (`REVIEW_RICH_ANCHORS_PROTOCOL_VERSION`)
  is exported because `panels/useReviewCommenting` refuses to send a `region`/`structural` draft to a host
  that predates them — such a host stores the selector unvalidated and re-anchors it as if it were text, so
  the comment would survive but mean something else; the refusal is a plain error toast at the one place
  drafts become `review.commentAdd` requests, and line/whole-file drafts are unaffected. The byte-only
  resource shape needs no gate: a host older than `RESOURCE_META_PROTOCOL_VERSION` answers `fs.readFile`
  and `git.diffFile` without `meta`, which the panes read as "text" — exactly the surface that host's own
  client showed — and `/blob` is only ever addressed for a side the host itself reported as byte-only.
- **Allowed deps:** `contracts` (method maps, `WS_CHANNELS`, `Project` for welcome + `project.updated`, `SessionEventPayload`
  for `pi.event`, `ExtUiRequest` for `pi.extensionUi`, `Workspace` for `workspace.created`/`updated`,
  `WorkspaceRemoved` for `workspace.removed`, `SessionCreatedPayload` for `session.created`,
  `SessionDeletedPayload` for `session.deleted`,
  `HOST_UPDATE_RUN_PROTOCOL_VERSION` + `Ack` + the typed `host.update` method for the CLI-host update action,
  `PLAN_REVIEW_SUBAGENT_PROTOCOL_VERSION` for the `supportsPlanReview` gate,
  `CHANGE_MUTATIONS_PROTOCOL_VERSION` for the diff-mutation gate, `REVIEW_RICH_ANCHORS_PROTOCOL_VERSION`
  for the rich-anchor authoring gate, `provider.changed`, the empty
  addressed `feedback.interview` invitation, `HostUpdateNotice` for `server.welcome` +
  `host.updateAvailable`,
  `WorkspaceFsChangedPayload` for `workspace.fsChanged`, and `AppConfig` for `server.welcome`'s config +
  `settings.changed`); `store`
  (welcome + event routing — a runtime edge owned by the parent graph); `lib` (plain-HTTP-safe random page
  identity); the browser `WebSocket`.
- **Forbidden:** `server`/`shared`/any `pi` package; importing `panels`/`shell`; or requesting, subscribing to, or folding current-layout state. Browser layout persistence uses only `httpBase()` as part of its frontend-local storage identity; native stable persistence has no transport edge.

## Get right

- **`DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS` is the ceiling a host-side budget has to fit under, and nothing enforces it.**
  The server bounds network `git` at 55s precisely so its own error — naming the ref, carrying git's
  stderr — wins the race against the causeless `request "…" timed out` this side raises at 60s (issue #209;
  `packages/server/src/git/SPEC.md`). Lower this number below that budget and every stalled fetch silently
  reverts to the generic timeout, with no test or type failing to say so. The two constants live in
  independently-shipped artifacts and are correct by agreement; deriving them from one another belongs in
  `contracts`. Raising a per-request `timeoutMs` is safe, lowering the default is not.
