## Responsibility

The app's dependency-light shared React primitives: the error boundary that keeps one failed region from
unmounting the root, project-custom icons, the binary attention dot and working-icon treatment used by
feature panels (currently the Projects rail), the quiet-scroll frame, and the shared loading-skeleton
primitive. Also houses the
`ui/` sub-module (shadcn primitives), which has its own spec.

## Boundary

- **Owns:** `ErrorBoundary.tsx` — a class boundary (`getDerivedStateFromError`) that renders a themed,
  self-contained fallback instead of propagating a throw to the root. It:
  - resets a caught error when any `resetKeys` value changes (wire to the subtree's identity —
    workspace/tab id — so navigating away auto-recovers);
  - classifies failed dynamic `import()`s via the pure, unit-tested **`isChunkLoadError`** (stale Vite
    chunk / 504 / Safari "module script failed") and steers those to a page **reload** (re-fetches the
    chunk) rather than an in-place retry;
  - logs the crash to the console (`componentDidCatch`) — the UI already degrades gracefully.
- **`CustomIcon.tsx`** — renders an SVG from `public/custom-icons/` as a themeable `currentColor` glyph
  via a CSS `mask-image` span (`.custom-icon*` classes in `index.css`), so a custom glyph sizes with
  `size-*` and colours with `text-*` exactly like a Remix icon. Names are a typed union
  (`CustomIconName`); today: `file-diff-line`/`file-diff-fill` (the Changes tool glyph).
- **`QuietScrollArea.tsx`** — the store-free overflow observer and two presentation surfaces:
  `QuietScrollArea` owns an ordinary native scroll viewport, while `QuietScrollFrame` observes a
  third-party descendant scroll control without taking over its content or input and can receive the
  library's authoritative edge state. `styles/global.css` owns the single scrollbar definition for every
  native scroll container: a 6px gutter, transparent track, transparent resting thumb, `--border-default`
  while the scrolling element is hovered or carries `data-quiet-scroll-intent`, and `--text-muted` on
  direct thumb hover/active. The reveal travels through an element-level custom property
  (`--scrollbar-thumb`) that the thumb pseudo-element and Firefox's `scrollbar-color` both read, because
  Chromium evaluates `:hover` inside a `::-webkit-scrollbar-*` selector against the scrollbar part, not
  the element; every element resets the property so a hovered ancestor never reveals its descendants. Bundled high-contrast
  themes keep a 2px resting hairline; OS forced-colours keeps a system-colour thumb and removes curtains;
  reduced motion removes transitions. `QuietScrollArea` and `QuietScrollFrame` therefore own no look: they
  add intent beyond hover (focus-within, active scrolling with a short grace period, pointer drags that
  leave the frame, touch), overflow measurement, and pointer-transparent 16px edge curtains on clipped
  directions. `QuietScrollFrame` also re-skins xterm's non-native slider to the same thumb (transparent
  underlying slider, a 6px optical thumb, opacity gated on intent and measured vertical overflow).
  Surface colour is an explicit semantic prop (`sidebar` or `terminal`), never inferred from arrangement.
- **`AttentionDot.tsx`** — the store-free, static green/accent dot whose sole accessible label is “Needs
  attention.” It carries no reason, count, tooltip, motion, or clearing behavior; callers decide only whether
  it is present. It is the one marker for both needs-input and unread-result attention.
- **`RunningIcon.tsx`** — a store-free wrapper for an identity icon whose existing colour must not change.
  While active it applies the shared `animate-working` breathing (opacity dips to ~22% while the glyph
  shrinks to 80%, 1.3s cycle) and the accessible label “Agent working”. The stock 2s fade to 50% was
  too faint on a 14px muted glyph to read peripherally; motion plus a deep dip is what makes it
  noticeable without changing hue or adding a marker. Reduced motion
  removes animation and uses the same-hue static treatment. It never renders a dot, spinner, count, or
  tooltip. Feature callers decide whether normalized host state says a top-level session is running.
- **Also owns:** `Skeleton.tsx` — `SkeletonRows`, the one pulsing-rows placeholder every loading surface
  uses, and `LoadingRegion`, the sized-wrapper shape around it that most call sites actually want (a
  `className` for the region's own padding/sizing, an optional `label` threaded to `SkeletonRows`'
  `role="status"` region rather than opening a second one, and an optional `testId`). The full loading
  vocabulary and its rules are below.
- **Public surface:** `ErrorBoundary`, `isChunkLoadError`, `SkeletonRows`, `LoadingRegion` — imported
  directly via `@/components/ErrorBoundary` / `@/components/Skeleton` (no barrel); `AttentionDot` via
  `@/components/AttentionDot`; `RunningIcon` via `@/components/RunningIcon`; `CustomIcon`,
  `CustomIconName` via `@/components/CustomIcon`; `QuietScrollArea`, `QuietScrollFrame`, and the
  `QuietScrollEdges` type via `@/components/QuietScrollArea`; `useNow()` via `@/components/useNow` (the
  wall clock as a `useSyncExternalStore` value on a shared 30 s ticker, so a render never calls `Date.now`
  itself). The `ui/` primitives are their own sub-module
  ([components/ui/SPEC.md](ui/SPEC.md)).
- **Allowed deps:** React, `@remixicon/react`, `lib` (`shallowEqualArrays` — the reset-keys comparison, shared
  rather than re-stated). Kept dependency-light on purpose, and `lib` is a leaf, so *any* region (shell,
  panels, `main.tsx`) can still wrap in it without creating a cycle.
- **Forbidden:** `store`/`transport`/`panels`/`shell`/`chat`/`contracts`; `server`/`shared`/`pi`; inline
  `style` objects or raw hex (fallback is themed with token utilities only).

## Loading vocabulary

The app's loading vocabulary is exactly **two-tier** — every async gap renders one of these two, never a
third thing, never bare text, never nothing:

1. **`SkeletonRows` (usually via `LoadingRegion`) — for a *content region***: any area that will fill with substantial content, however
   that region is framed (a tool panel, a dialog's list, a menu's list section, a tab body, a `Suspense`
   fallback restoring a chat/plan/editor). **Surface size decides the tier, not the container type** — a
   spinner centred in a large empty region reads as a heavier, more alarming kind of wait than the
   content-shaped skeleton used one panel over for the identical "data is on the way" situation, so a
   region is never spinner-only regardless of what widget it lives inside (a dialog, a dropdown, a
   workbench tab). Reference sites: `panels/FileTree.tsx`, `panels/SpecsPanel.tsx`,
   `panels/ChangesPanel.tsx`, `panels/ReviewPanel.tsx`, `panels/PlanPane.tsx`, `panels/ProjectTree.tsx`
   (worktree list), `panels/ExistingWorktreeDialog.tsx` (worktree-candidate list),
   `panels/ChangesScopeMenu.tsx` (commit list), `panels/WelcomePanel.tsx`'s `CardSkeleton` (a hand-shaped
   variant sized to the cards it stands in for, since a generic row list would misrepresent a card grid's
   footprint), and `shell/WorkspaceWorkbench.tsx`'s `MissingResource` (every chat/plan/editor tab-body and
   lazy-chunk `Suspense` fallback).
2. **`Loader2` spinner (usually beside a short label) — for an *in-flight action or transient state* pinned
   to its control**: a single button, one menu item, one icon — never a whole region. Reference sites:
   the "New chat"/"Creating…" button states, `shell/WorkspaceChatHistory.tsx`'s history icon,
   `chat/ActivityGroup.tsx`/`chat/ToolCard.tsx` step icons, `panels/ProjectTree.tsx`'s "Creating worktree…"
   pending row. A narrower named sub-idiom of this tier: **`RefreshCw` spinning in place** (icon unchanged,
   just rotating) for a manual "Refresh" action on a control whose surrounding content stays visible and
   valid while the refresh runs (`chat/ModelEffortPicker.tsx`, `chat/ModelSelector.tsx`, `panels/GithubSettings.tsx`,
   `panels/ProvidersSettings.tsx`, `panels/BranchPicker.tsx`) — swapping to a generic spinner there would
   discard the "this still works, just refreshing" signal the in-place spin gives for free.

Beyond picking the right tier:

- **No layout jump.** A loading state occupies the same footprint the arriving content will — a skeleton
  sized/shaped for its region, a `CardSkeleton` sized like the card it precedes — so the data replacing it
  never shifts anything around it.
- **A retry/error affordance is never paired with an active loading indicator.** Showing "Retry" next to a
  spinner or skeleton sends two contradictory signals at once ("this is normal, wait" and "this already
  failed, act") for what is, in the overwhelming majority of cases, still-normal loading. Two legitimate
  shapes: (a) the retry button appears **only after a real failure** — a rejected request lands in a
  `catch`, e.g. `panels/ChangesPanel.tsx`'s `changes-retry`, `panels/ExistingWorktreeDialog.tsx`'s
  `existing-worktree-retry`; or (b) for a resource an *automatic* background process is already racing to
  restore (chat-session hydration via `shell/chatReconciliation`), the loading indicator shows alone and a
  retry affordance surfaces only once that automatic attempt has stayed stalled past a short grace window —
  `shell/WorkspaceWorkbench.tsx`'s `ChatResourceBody`/`CHAT_RETRY_DELAY_MS` is the reference
  implementation; reach for the same shape before inventing a new one.
- **Conditionally-absent content is not a loading state.** When "still loading" and "definitely nothing
  here" render identically (both blank) *and* blank is the correct steady state — not merely an
  unhandled gap — showing nothing while unresolved is correct, not a defect: `chat/ChatPlan.tsx`'s
  `plan.data === null` guard is gated at its call site (`chat/ChatView.tsx` only mounts the plan
  strip/popover once `plan.data` exists at all), so there is no "empty region promising content" the way
  `panels/WelcomePanel.tsx`'s always-eventually-populated card row has. Reach for a skeleton only when the
  region is guaranteed to fill; reach for nothing only when it may legitimately never fill and the caller
  already treats absence as absence, not as a pending state.
- Bare "Loading…"/"Restoring…" text with neither a skeleton nor a spinner is a defect, full stop.
- **The resolved content fades in rather than popping in.** Once a skeleton's data arrives, the element that
  replaces it carries `motion-safe:animate-reveal` (`index.css`'s shared `reveal` keyframe — 150ms
  opacity+translateY, the same primitive `chat/tools/AskUserQuestionCard.tsx` already uses for a card
  settling into place; `motion-safe:` so `prefers-reduced-motion` gets an instant swap instead). It goes on
  the resolved branch's own root — never the skeleton, never a wrapper that also encloses the skeleton
  branch (a `Suspense` boundary's *children*, not the `Suspense` element itself) — because the animation
  plays once on that element's mount, and a shared wrapper around both branches would fire on first paint,
  before the data (or the resolved content itself) exists to fade in. It never re-fires on ordinary
  re-renders (a longer todo list, a new chat message) because React reconciles the same persistent DOM node
  across those — only the branch switch is a real mount. The registered `RenderedDiff`/`MarkdownPreview`
  roots carry it — but pointedly **not** `MonacoEditor`'s: `@monaco-editor/react` shows its own second
  `loading={<SkeletonRows/>}` internally while Monaco's own runtime boots, *after* our `Suspense` chunk has
  already resolved, so wrapping our `Suspense` boundary there fades in — a still-loading skeleton, not the
  real editor, an animated flash into a second, unanimated skeleton swap that reads as two different loading
  indicators blinking rather than one. The correct fix for that stacked case would live inside
  `MonacoEditor`'s own `loading` render (an internal library-boot state we don't otherwise touch), not at the outer call site — left unanimated
  until that's worth doing. A terminal body (`TerminalWorkbenchBody`) skips the reveal too, since a
  terminal's PTY attach is gated on its own visibility mount and is not worth risking for a cosmetic fade,
  and a Radix menu's items skip it as well, since wrapping bare `DropdownMenuItem`s in a div breaks the
  primitive's direct-child keyboard/typeahead traversal (`panels/ChangesScopeMenu.tsx`'s commit list stays
  skeleton-then-pop for this reason). `chat/ChatView.tsx`
  skips it for a sharper reason: a non-`none` `transform` on an ancestor — including mid-animation, before
  the keyframe settles at `none` — establishes a new containing block, which broke the sticky positioning
  of `chat/activityBreadcrumbs.tsx`'s breadcrumb bar nested inside it (`e2e/activity-breadcrumbs.spec.ts`
  caught this in review). Anything with a `position: sticky`/`fixed` descendant is disqualified from this
  transform-based reveal outright, no exception list needed — check for one before adding it.

## Get right

- **Scope of protection:** React boundaries catch **render + lazy-import** throws only — **not** errors in
  event handlers, effects, or rejected promises (e.g. `transport.request`). Those surface through
  `transport`'s `errorText()` as an error turn/notice, not here. The shell's "panels can't blank the app"
  guarantee is about render/lazy-load; async failures are a separate path.
- Where the error boundary is mounted (each region + the last-resort root wrap) is owned by `shell/SPEC.md`
  and the parent dependency graph in `apps/web/SPEC.md`, not repeated here.
- Quiet-scroll intent is local to its rendered surface, not the workbench's remembered active group. A
  wheel/trackpad gesture need not move DOM focus, while remembered group focus would leave one rail visible
  indefinitely. The third-party frame therefore observes focus and pointer intent at its own host and adds
  only a visual/measurement adapter; it never reads shell placement.
