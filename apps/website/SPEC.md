## Responsibility

The project's public website at `thinkrail.ai`: the IDE-shell landing, its blog, and the audience-specific
vibecoding experience at `/vibecoding/` (also served, with per-route hero titles and copy variants
and a canonical back to `/vibecoding/`, at `/agentic-development/` and `/agentic-ide/`). The landing and blog's creative conceit is that **the site IS
the IDE**: a faithful HTML/CSS recreation of the ThinkRail shell (title bar, project rail, tab strip,
files rail, terminal, status bar) whose center "editor" is the normally-scrolling page content. Each
landing section poses as a file of a `website` workspace (`README.md`, `why.md`, `features/*.md`,
`INSTALL.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`). The **file tree is the source of truth for the page's navigation
structure**, and its selection reacts to scroll (scroll-spy) like the editor is switching files. The
top editor **tab strip is derived from that file-tree navigation** — not a hand-maintained list — and
is interactive: the active tab **follows the currently visible section via the same scroll-spy**, and
**clicking a tab scrolls to its section**. The strip holds **exactly one navigational tab per unique
section target**: the tree may stay hierarchical and repeat a target across rows, but duplicate
targets collapse to a single tab, so scroll-spy always activates exactly one tab per section. The
strip **scrolls** (`overflow-x: auto`, scrollbar hidden) — the tabs overflow below ~1500px and every one
must stay reachable. Its bottom divider is drawn **per tab**, not on the strip: a strip border sits
outside the scrollport, where the active tab cannot paint over it to merge into the content. The
status bar is a plain copyright footer, not a live line counter.

`/vibecoding/` deliberately uses a separate visual grammar: [[submodule-website-vibecoding]] owns the
animated product story and install experience as a route-local React island with route-local Tailwind.
It shares the website origin, artifact, analytics initializer, SEO outputs, and deployment—not the
IDE-shell presentation.

Not part of the product: nothing in the app depends on the public website, and it never ships in the
binary.

## Boundary

- **Independently deployed leaf.** Its only workspace dependency is [[module-website-analytics]]; it
  must never import contracts, server, shared, or web. It never joins the product host wire;
  [[submodule-website-attribution]] alone owns an independent, bounded HTTP claim protocol and D1 state.
- **One static Astro artifact plus same-project claim functions, with a route-local framework exception.**
  The landing and blog retain vanilla TypeScript + hand-written CSS: no React island and no Tailwind
  stylesheet or runtime reaches those routes. [[submodule-website-attribution]] alone adds Pages Functions
  and D1; only `/vibecoding/`, `/agentic-development/`, and `/agentic-ide/` may use the shared React
  island and Tailwind v4. Astro's React integration and Tailwind Vite plugin are build-wide tooling; build validation
  requires one island in each allowed route output and rejects islands in the fixed landing, blog,
  article, and claim outputs. The browser analytics
  workspace module is compiled into the static output. The `@fontsource-variable/*` packages are
  build-time asset sources whose woff2 files are emitted into `dist/`. Shared with `apps/web`, they
  come from the root `workspaces.catalog` — one pin for both apps that keeps the site's faces
  identical to the app's.
  - *Why Astro (decision, 2026-08):* the blog + planned docs fired the "bespoke SSG" tripwires
    (RSS, OG, typed frontmatter, content DX). Astro is Vite underneath — the landing page ported
    verbatim, `bun test` suites unchanged — and React 19 islands are available only where a route needs
    one. Rejected: Next.js static export (ships the React runtime to static pages, non-Vite culture),
    VitePress (Vue), Eleventy (docs features assemble-yourself — the bespoke trap again), Hugo/Zola
    (non-TS toolchain, token/tests integration lost). The prior bespoke pipeline
    (`scripts/build-blog.ts` + HTML string templates) is deleted.
  - *Lint caveat:* Biome parses only `.astro` frontmatter, so `noUnusedVariables`/`noUnusedImports`
    are disabled for `*.astro` in `biome.json` (template usage is invisible to it — every flag would
    be a false positive). `astro check` covers the templates instead.

The parent owns the route-composition edges; the vibecoding leaf has no sibling dependency:

```text
src/pages/{vibecoding,agentic-development,agentic-ide}/index.astro ──▶ src/vibecoding (through index.ts)
src/pages/{vibecoding,agentic-development,agentic-ide}/index.astro ──▶ src/components/Analytics.astro
landing + blog shells                                              ──▶ src/components/Analytics.astro
```

- **Fonts are self-hosted; the site makes no external font request.** Packages and stacks are copied
  from the app's `typography.json`, not imported — and `src/fonts.test.ts` reads that JSON at test time
  and fails on drift, which is what makes copying safe. `--font-display` mirrors the app's `brand`
  family — **Orbitron** (`@fontsource-variable/orbitron`, self-hosted), a distinct display face for the
  brand elements (wordmark + hero heading), falling back to `--font-sans`; section headings and the
  tagline are the interface face (`--font-sans`), matching the app.
- **Brand values are copied, not imported.** Theme palettes are lifted at authoring time from
  `apps/web/src/themes/bundled/*.theme.json` (dark = default, darcula, light, gruvbox) into the site's
  own CSS custom properties under `[data-theme]`; the site never reaches into `apps/web` at build time
  (the app's tokens assume the theme engine's runtime swap).
- **IDE-shell page chrome is single-sourced in components.** `src/components/BaseHead.astro` is the one
  head the landing and blog use: charset/viewport, favicon, their global stylesheet (which bundles the
  fonts), and the pre-paint theme guard. `src/components/Analytics.astro` is presentation-free and is
  included once by every route family. `src/components/IdeShell.astro` is the one IDE shell the landing
  and blog render through — icon sprite, skip link, title bar (workspace name
  parameterized: `website` on the landing, `blog` on blog pages, each with the matching
  `workspace/<name> · from main` branch label), the left project rail, the right files rail +
  terminal, the status bar, and the `main.ts` script import; the center column is its default slot
  and the right rail's Files rows its `filetree` slot. The left rail carries the site's real
  navigation as child rows of the `website` workspace — **Landing** (`/`) and **Blog** (`/blog/`,
  selected on the index and on every article) as links, **Docs** disabled with a `Coming soon` chip
  (no tooltip — the tag carries the state) — while the remaining mock rows keep the
  `data-mock-hint` treatment; the selected row wears the same accent-tinted grammar as the right
  rail's active file row (one grouped CSS rule). `src/components/Copyright.astro` is the one
  copyright line (shell statusbar). The dark/light theme model lives in
  `src/theme.ts` (explicit choice in `localStorage` → `prefers-color-scheme` fallback, live
  system-follow, legacy `darcula`/`gruvbox` values normalize to dark); the inline FOUC guard in
  BaseHead is its declared twin — a behavior change updates both.
- **A colour with a contrast floor gets a `:root` token, never the region-inherited `--accent`.**
  A region may re-point `--accent` (the light theme's kicker pill does; the hero once did), so
  descendants reading it can inherit a value chosen for another surface. `--link` and `--focus-ring`
  are declared once on `:root` as `var(--accent)`, which resolves against the *root* accent —
  per-theme, but out of reach of a region override.
- **The primary button (and the hero's brand accents) are per-theme, not a brand constant** (decision
  reversed 2026-08 on review — the light theme kept the dark theme's bright green): the
  `--control-primary-*` tokens mirror the app's semantic mapping (`bg = accent`, `hovered =
  accentHover`, `text = onAccent`, per `apps/web/src/styles/colors.json`), declared on `:root` via the
  root-token mechanism above, with `--accent-hover` copied per theme from the app's palettes. The hero
  title follows the theme accent like every other accent-coloured element; `palette.test.ts` pins the
  hovered-fill label contrast.
- All marketing copy is static DOM text; JS only *enhances* (scroll-spy, the derived editor-tab strip
  and its scroll-spy/click navigation, terminal typing, chat streaming replay, theme switcher, copy
  buttons, star count, install-platform selection). The page must read complete with JS disabled (the
  editor tabs are a JS-built navigation affordance over content that is already reachable by scrolling
  and via the file tree), and animations are skipped under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Enhancement behaviors owned by `main.ts`** (the code carries no rationale — this is it):
  - *Terminal replay*: the hero install picker keeps the selected OS/shell's primary desktop action and
    **Browser UI via command line** disclosure together; the launcher command inside static markup is the single source of truth for the terminal,
    which subscribes and types it before the short install transcript. A generation counter invalidates an
    in-flight sequence on OS change; clicking the
    *finished* terminal (or its keyboard-reachable `Replay logo` button, revealed only then) replays
    the ASCII logo + a GitHub CTA — never the install. The logo banner's characters are never
    altered; only its font size is fitted to the rail width (re-fitted on resize).
  - *Worktree note* (left rail): starts visible in markup (reads with JS disabled); an inline script
    hides it pre-paint and `main.ts` reveals it after 5s — once per session (`sessionStorage`),
    never again after Understood (`localStorage`), with a 10s inline-script fallback if `main.ts`
    fails to load. Storage access is fully guarded (retrieving the storage object itself can throw).
  - *Mock-callout tooltips*: `data-mock-hint` regions (right-rail tabs, the left rail's remaining
    mock rows) open a click-persistent callout with a GitHub CTA — click-outside/Escape closes,
    Escape restores focus. A11y contract: the trigger becomes `role="button"` with `aria-label`
    (from `data-mock-label`), `aria-expanded` + `aria-describedby` on open — no `aria-haspopup`
    (a `tooltip` is not an allowed popup value). The `.rail-tabs` callout anchors to the panel's
    live edge; others place beside the trigger, clamped to the viewport and repositioned on resize.
- The hero's install experience has compact **macOS / Windows / Linux** tabs and makes the stable
  desktop application the only expanded action in each panel: macOS Apple Silicon DMG, Windows x64
  setup ZIP, and distinct Linux x64 / ARM64 setup archives. Each panel carries one compatibility line;
  it does not repeat product name, desktop/stability prose, or format outside the action label. A native
  **Browser UI via command line** disclosure retains the local launcher and explains that `thinkrail` opens
  the browser UI, without presenting a second terminal-only interface. Windows
  adds **PowerShell / Command Prompt (cmd) / WSL** tabs only inside that disclosure: PowerShell runs
  `irm …/install.ps1 | iex`, Command Prompt launches `powershell -c "irm …/install.ps1 | iex"`, and
  WSL uses `install.sh`. The closed picker stays under 150px on desktop and 190px on mobile. Versionless
  GitHub `releases/latest/download` URLs name the public aliases owned by [[module-ci-release]]; the
  website carries no release version, updater payload name, or private artifact knowledge. Browser hints
  choose only the initial supported desktop OS; they never hide alternatives, infer Linux CPU architecture,
  or claim to detect an ambiguous mobile platform. Every panel remains in the static DOM; JS turns the
  complete fallback into tabs, while `<details>` owns keyboard/no-JS disclosure semantics. The detailed
  `INSTALL.md` section is one compact platform-row matrix plus one browser-UI-via-command-line disclosure;
  nightly/version examples
  live in release documentation rather than the marketing page.

## Analytics and consent

`src/analytics.ts` is the site-local facade over [[module-website-analytics]]. It supplies the exact
production hostname `thinkrail.ai` and adapts Cookiebot's response-aware Marketing state plus
consent-ready/accept/decline events to the shared current-value/subscription contract; the shared module owns the PostHog and GTM identifiers,
journey persistence, typed capture, privacy configuration, and script loaders. Unknown or denied Marketing
state stays cookieless and carries no journey ID. Localhost, `astro dev`, every `pages.dev` deployment, the
`jetbrains.github.io` address, and sibling subdomains send nothing.

`src/components/Analytics.astro` initializes that facade and then the idempotent site event delegation
once per document; it remains the analytics composition point for the IDE-shell and vibecoding routes.
Content keys derive from `window.location.pathname`: `/` → `landing`, `/blog/` → `blog/index`, and
other paths containing only lowercase safe characters become the path without outer slashes (so
`/blog/<slug>/` → `blog/<slug>`). Keys allow only lowercase letters, digits, hyphens, and path
separators and are limited to 105 characters, enough for `blog/` plus the maximum 100-character post
slug; invalid paths emit no content or action events. Query and fragment strings are absent from
`pathname`; dotted `index.html` paths are not route aliases. New pages and posts need no analytics code
change. Only pages composed with Analytics load it: the authored `src/pages/404.astro` is a standalone,
analytics-free page served for unknown URLs, and the standalone `/attribution/claim/` page remains
analytics-free. Each valid document emits one explicit `content_viewed` with its derived key. Build
validation recursively checks every emitted `.html` document for exactly one PostHog and GTM loader,
except the explicit analytics-free `404.html` and `/attribution/claim/` outputs, which must contain
neither loader nor browser analytics. Route-specific layout, artifact, and SEO checks remain focused
on their owning routes.

At initialization, the current page touch is recorded only when a consented journey already exists;
journey appearance after initialization does not replay the page URL or referrer, and journey removal
clears attribution context. Touches carry only bounded UTM values, referrer class, timestamp, and policy
version; they do not transfer a page key. Website events retain their `content_key` and journey identity,
so PostHog joins those events to the app's `acquisition_linked.journey_id` for landing/last-page analysis.
Document-level `click`, middle-button `auxclick`, and disclosure `toggle`
delegation instruments the static install controls without changing their navigation or no-JS behavior.
Before each post-initialization install CTA, download, or CLI event, the current navigation touch is
attempted so consent granted on the page can affect only a subsequent action. Only the four exact stable
GitHub desktop aliases are downloads. Their CTA location comes from the containing hero, install
section, quick start, final CTA, or blog post; one recognized activation emits `install_cta_clicked`
(`desktop`) followed by `download_started`. When a consented journey context is available, the activation
creates and stores a canonical per-download bridge ID before `download_started`, and that event carries
the same ID. A later desktop download replaces only the stored latest bridge ID; a download without
consent remains bridge-less. Opening either landing command-line disclosure emits only
`install_cta_clicked` (`cli`); closing it does not. No page or child module carries analytics imports,
vendor configuration, or another loader.

The existing GTM container remains Cookiebot's control plane; route-specific downstream tags use a
`thinkrail.ai` hostname condition plus Page Path, never another GTM container. Sharing the exact apex
origin means Cookiebot scans and browser consent state apply to all three route families.

Site tests pin production-host identity, disabled hosts, the Cookiebot adapter, every route key and
stable desktop alias, event derivation, and initializer idempotence. The shared package tests the
PostHog/GTM, journey and capture contracts. The shared contract deliberately has no `posthog-js`
dependency, pasted bootstrap, or static GTM `noscript` iframe.

The non-indexed `/attribution/claim/` route belongs to [[submodule-website-attribution]]; its
analytics-free page silently attempts the claim bind on load only when the current Cookiebot
`CookieConsent` cookie records a Marketing grant or `-1`, then navigates to `/blog/`. That module owns
the claim protocol and framing protections.

## Deploy

Cloudflare Pages project `thinkrail-website` owns production and previews for the static artifact and
claim Functions. Pinned Wrangler `4.124.0` deploys from `apps/website` so its configuration,
`functions/`, and `dist` artifact form one deployment. The top-level `ATTRIBUTION_DB` serves production
and local Pages/D1 workflows; production applies committed attribution migrations before deploy. The
build compiles the Functions, and a local Pages/D1 smoke starts Pages from the checked-in configuration,
applies the actual migration, and exercises create, bind, and redeem. `.github/workflows/site.yml` runs
`bun run --filter @thinkrail/website build` (`astro check`, the Functions typecheck and build, `astro
build`, and artifact validation) on pushes that
touch this module, [[module-website-analytics]], the root package manifest, or the lockfile (plus manual
dispatch). It verifies the provider URL before succeeding. `thinkrail.ai` is the project's custom apex
domain; provider URLs are deployment probes, not product identities.

Production concurrency never cancels an in-flight publish. Cloudflare retains successful production
deployments as rollback targets, so rollback selects the prior `main` deployment instead of running a
second hosting pipeline.

### PR preview deploys

`.github/workflows/site-preview.yml` runs the same build command and uploads to branch `pr-<number>` in
`thinkrail-website`. The Wrangler `env.preview` override gives preview deployments no D1 binding;
the production-origin guard independently continues to return not-found for preview attribution
requests before D1 access. The deterministic alias
`https://pr-<number>.thinkrail-website.pages.dev` is surfaced as one sticky PR comment and one
`Website preview` commit status covering `/`, `/blog/`, `/vibecoding/`, `/agentic-development/`,
and `/agentic-ide/`. It waits for all of those routes to serve before publishing the URL.

Same-repository PRs only receive previews; fork PRs skip because Cloudflare credentials never cross the
repository boundary. Preview URLs are public and analytics-silent while their PR is open. A separate
close workflow recognizes the sticky preview marker, deletes every deployment for that PR branch, and
marks its preview metadata retired; PRs without that marker are no-ops. The shared concurrency group
prevents cleanup racing an in-flight publish. A newer push cancels only the superseded preview for that
PR.

One-time setup creates `thinkrail-website` with production branch `main`, using
`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (Pages:Edit plus D1:Edit for committed attribution migrations) and
`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` repository secrets, then attaches the `thinkrail.ai` custom domain after the
provider-hosted main deployment is verified. The token permission update must land before the first
claim-enabled production deployment.

### Hosting and retired hostname

Cloudflare-managed DNS routes `thinkrail.ai` to the verified `main` deployment. Production rollback
selects a prior successful `main` deployment through Pages; legacy hosting is not part of the steady
state.

`vibecoding.thinkrail.ai` is a Cloudflare Single Redirect: hostname match, dynamic target
`concat("https://thinkrail.ai/vibecoding", http.request.uri.path)`, status 301, and query preservation
enabled. Its originless proxied `192.0.2.1` record keeps the redirect resolvable without a deployment.

## Blog

The `/blog` subsite is a typed Astro content collection over Markdown posts in `content/blog/`
(each post: a folder with `index.md` + optional `images/`), rendered by `src/pages/blog/` through
`src/layouts/BlogLayout.astro`. Published posts that carry live installation guidance follow the
current desktop-first hierarchy rather than freezing obsolete CLI-only instructions.

- **Schema is the gate** (`src/content.config.ts`, zod): required `title`/`slug`/`date`/`author`,
  optional `excerpt`/`draft`/`tags`. A malformed or reserved slug, a missing field, an unknown
  `author` key, or two posts sharing a slug **fails the build** — no silent green deploys. Drafts
  render in `astro dev` (author preview, hot reload) and are excluded from production builds (`src/blogCollection.ts`, the one
  query — newest-first, draft-filtered — that the index, post pages, and RSS all share).
- **URLs are directory-style** (`/blog/<slug>/`), decided while the blog was unpublished so nothing
  broke; RSS at `/blog/rss.xml` (`@astrojs/rss`). Post pages carry meta description (the excerpt),
  canonical, OG/article tags.
- **Code blocks**: Astro's built-in Shiki, dual `github-light`/`github-dark` themes emitted as
  `--shiki-light`/`--shiki-dark` CSS vars (`defaultColor: false`) so the site's `[data-theme]`
  switch — not a media query — picks the palette. Styled under `.astro-code` in `src/styles.css`.
- **YouTube embeds must be cookieless**: authors write plain iframes; the Sätteri HAST plugin
  `src/youTubeEmbeds.ts` (Astro 7's native Markdown processor — the unified/rehype pipeline is a
  separate legacy package we don't carry) rewrites `youtube.com/embed` → `youtube-nocookie.com` and
  adds `title` + `loading="lazy"` when omitted. This keeps the no-consent-banner stance intact.
- **Chrome: blog pages live inside the IDE shell**, not a separate page frame (decision, 2026-08 —
  the prior standalone blog header/footer is deleted). `BlogLayout.astro` renders through
  `IdeShell.astro`: the content sits in the same scrolling editor pane as the landing sections, in a
  `.blog-main` container sharing their exact geometry (one grouped `.file-section, .blog-main` CSS
  rule — deliberately *not* the `.file-section` class, whose typography cascade would fight the blog
  content styles). Opening an article replaces the index in that same central area. **No tab strip on
  blog pages** (the landing keeps its section tabs; page-level Landing/Blog tabs were explicitly
  rejected for now). The right rail's Files list shows the published articles (current one
  active); the terminal keeps its static install transcript — `main.ts` guards make every
  landing-only enhancement inert (no sections → no scroll-spy, no picker → no terminal replay).
  Post cards are whole-card links that signal hover on the border alone (no underline, no movement)
  and share the landing feature cards' surface, which keeps the `--elevated` tag chips visible on
  them. Theming: BaseHead (theme guard, fonts, analytics) + the `src/theme.ts` toggle via the
  shell's `main.ts` — same behavior as the landing page, one implementation.
- **Authors are a shared entity, not a per-post string.** A second collection (`authors`) loads
  `content/authors.json` through Astro's `file()` loader — one object keyed by author key, schema
  `name` required + `url` optional (present ⇒ the byline name renders as a link). Posts carry
  `author: reference("authors")`, **required**, so referential integrity is the framework's check:
  a misspelled key is a build failure, and a renamed author or a new link updates every post at once.
  Resolution is centralized as `postAuthor()` in `src/blogCollection.ts`; no page inlines the lookup.
  Avatar/role fields are deliberately absent — a schema field with no renderer is dead surface;
  both are additive later.
  - *Byline placement (decision, 2026-08):* the **post header only**, as the first item of the
    `.blog-post-meta` row (`author · date · reading time`), sharing the date's hint colour, size, and
    one grouped `·` separator rule. Index cards, RSS items, OG/`article:author` meta, an end-of-post
    author card, and `/blog/authors/<key>/` pages were each considered and declined for now — the
    shared entity keeps every one of them a cheap follow-up.
- **Author guide**: `content/blog/BLOG.md` documents the frontmatter schema, the author profiles,
  Markdown features, embeds, and the local preview loop (`bun run dev` hot-reloads posts).
  them. Theming: BaseHead (theme guard + fonts) + the `src/theme.ts` toggle via the shell's `main.ts`
  — same behavior as the landing page, one implementation; Analytics remains the separate shared head
  initializer.
- **Author guide**: `content/blog/BLOG.md` documents the frontmatter schema, Markdown features,
  embeds, and the local preview loop (`bun run dev` hot-reloads posts).
- **Deployment**: alongside the main site via the same `site.yml` workflow; changes to
  `apps/website/content/blog/**` trigger a rebuild.

## Discovery and assets

One apex `robots.txt` allows the public site and points crawlers at Astro's generated sitemap. The
sitemap derives from the same static route build and therefore covers `/`, the blog index and published
posts, and `/vibecoding/`; `/agentic-development/` and `/agentic-ide/` are filtered out of the
sitemap because they canonicalize to `/vibecoding/` (see [[submodule-website-vibecoding]]). Previews keep production
canonical URLs and do not become a second search identity.

`public/favicon.svg` is the IDE-shell landing/blog tab icon: a rounded tile in the brand primary green carrying the
**header wordmark's TR mark** (same `viewBox` + paths, not redrawn) in black, centred with balanced
padding for legibility at tab sizes. It is wired via `<link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml">` in
`index.html`; there is no `.ico` fallback.

`public/og.png` is a capture of the site's own hero inside the IDE shell (dark theme, Landing
selected, terminal install transcript finished, worktree note visible). The transcript in the
`features/agent-chat.md` section is from a real `pi` session captured in the app while it worked on
this repo. Re-capture: `astro preview` the built site, view it at a 1200×630 viewport with
deviceScaleFactor 2 (dark theme), wait for the terminal replay + the rail note (~7s), screenshot the
viewport, and downscale the 2400×1260 capture to 1200×630.

`public/vibecoding/` owns that route's distinct favicon, 1200×630 Open Graph image, and gradient
wordmark. Their public URLs remain under `/vibecoding/`, while Vite-generated chunks stay under the
site-wide `/_astro/` root because one Astro base serves all route families.
