## Responsibility

Run one child process to completion under a wall-clock budget, and return what it wrote. The single
answer to "how does this host spawn something that might never come back" — the lifetime mechanics only,
never what a particular child's output means.

## Boundary

- **Owns:** `runBounded(argv, { timeoutMs, cwd?, env?, stdout? })` →
  `{ ok, out, err, timedOut, launchFailed, waitedMs }`: capture both streams and complete on the child's
  **exit**; stdout defaults to decoded text, while `stdout: "bytes"` preserves it as `Uint8Array` for
  callers reading opaque content (stderr remains text diagnostics). POSIX children are detached
  process-group leaders, while Windows children retain a nonvisual console. Expiry kills the POSIX group
  or the direct Windows child. A failed launch is a result (`ok: false`, `launchFailed: true`, the launch
  error as `err`), never a throw; callers can distinguish infrastructure failure from a child that ran
  and exited nonzero.
- **Also owns:** `streamBounded(argv, { timeoutMs, cwd?, env? })` → `{ stdout, exited }` — the same
  spawn, deadline, group kill and stderr capture, for the one caller that must relay a child's stdout
  while it is still being produced (the host's `/blob` route). Completion is still the child's exit,
  with the same pipe-holding-grandchild rule as `runBounded`: a read that is still pending
  `DRAIN_GRACE_MS` after the child exited is cancelled, because what has not arrived by then is not
  our child's output; a read issued *after* the exit gets the same grace from the moment it is issued,
  so a slow consumer draining the pipe's remainder is never cut short — back-pressure is preserved up
  to the exit, and only the hang is bounded. The `stdout` stream **closes** only after a zero exit and
  **errors** after a nonzero exit, an expiry or a failed launch, so a consumer can never mistake a
  truncated relay for a complete one; cancelling the stream kills the child. `exited` resolves to the
  same shape `runBounded` returns, minus `out`.
- **Public surface:** `runBounded`, `streamBounded`, `BoundedRun`, `BoundedBytesRun`, `BoundedRunOptions`,
  `BoundedBytesRunOptions`, `BoundedStream`, `BoundedStreamOptions`.
- **Allowed deps:** Bun/Node process APIs. Nothing else — it knows no feature, no wire type, no
  persistence.
- **Forbidden:** message wording, retry, truncation, or any policy about a specific program. `git`'s
  stalled/stderr text and `branch-review`'s degrade-to-`null` are the callers' business.
- **Known non-consumers.** Two callers spawn something that can outlast a human's patience and still do
  it themselves, each deliberately and each a standing debt rather than a settled design:
  - `@thinkrail/shared/jbcentral` — already deadline-first, and a different contract (bounded-byte reads, a
    closed outcome vocabulary, an injectable `run` seam, Central's confidentiality rules). Folding it in
    would grow this surface for one caller in another package.
  - `dialog`'s `selectDirectory` (`dialog.ts`) — still the EOF-gated shape this module replaces, around
    `zenity`/`kdialog`/`osascript`, whose forked helpers inherit stdio. Unmigrated because a picker's real
    budget is a human at a dialog: it needs a cancellation seam, which `runBounded` does not offer.

  `github`'s `githubAuthStatus` (`github.ts`) used to be a third — a `spawnSync` HTTPS call on the single
  event loop — until it moved onto `runBounded`, which is also why `ghSetupProblem` no longer hand-rolls its
  own TERM+KILL escalation: both `gh auth status` probes now share this module's timeout mechanics instead
  of duplicating them.

  The census above is about *unbounded waits*, not about every spawn in the repo — the rest are already
  bounded or cannot wait on anything: `git`'s sync `git()` and `terminal/shellBusy` go through
  `@thinkrail/shared/spawn`'s `spawnSyncCaptured` (`shared/shellEnv` keeps its own `Bun.spawnSync` — a
  win32 no-op), and `editors`, `cli/bootstrap` and `cli/powershell` are fire-and-forget
  `@thinkrail/shared/spawn` `spawnDetached`s whose output nobody reads. `trash`'s helper `execFile` is the
  one true straggler: unbounded, but a local trash helper with no network and no prompt, so it fails the
  letter of this module and not its purpose.

## Get right

- **Completion is the child exiting, never its pipes reaching EOF.** A grandchild that inherits the child's
  `stdout`/`stderr` and outlives it holds the write end open, so an EOF-gated read never returns — and
  because the read *was* the completion signal, a child that finished successfully in milliseconds was
  reported as a full-budget timeout (`git` + a backgrounded `ssh`, issue #209's second face). `Bun.spawn`'s
  own `timeout` option gates the same way and is not an alternative.
- **The deadline races the child's *exit*, and the drain grace runs after that race is decided.** The
  grace is not part of the budget: racing the deadline against the *post-grace* settle instead turned the
  last `DRAIN_GRACE_MS` of every budget into a false-timeout window, because a grandchild holding the pipes
  makes the grace run to full term every time. A `git fetch` that answered at 54.9s of its 55s came back as
  the stalled wording with `ok: false`, and its healthy process group was SIGKILLed on the way out. Pinned
  by a test whose child exits immediately behind a pipe-holding grandchild under a 250ms budget.
- **The drain grace (250ms) runs on *both* outcomes, exit and expiry.** It cannot truncate the child's own
  output: a pipe holds at most its buffer, and a child that writes more than that is *blocked* until the
  reader drains it — so at exit everything left is already buffered and drains in microseconds; the grace
  only covers scheduler latency. Anything arriving after it can only come from a process that is not our
  child — and is still captured as if it were the child's, which is a known wart, not a guarantee. The
  constant is pinned from the other side: a test asserts each path *waits it out* (and no longer) when a
  grandchild keeps the pipes from ever reaching EOF, which is the only case where it is observable at all.
- **The timeout path drains too — cancelling the readers on the spot dropped the diagnosis.** The group
  kill is what closes the write ends, so the bytes still in the pipe at expiry are exactly the ones the
  caller's message is built from: git's `Permission denied (publickey)`, a proxy's refusal, a `remote:`
  progress line proving a large transfer was simply still running. Killing and then cancelling in the same
  synchronous step raced a pending `read()` against that cancel and could throw the last chunk away —
  a caller promising "whatever git wrote before the kill" while dropping git's last word. Post-kill the
  reads hit EOF almost at once, so the grace costs nothing in the normal case and caps the pathological one
  (a holder that escaped the group via its own `setsid`, which is what the test uses to make the wait
  observable).
- **`timeoutMs` is clamped before it reaches `setTimeout`.** The type says `number`, and `setTimeout`
  silently collapses `Infinity`, `NaN`, negatives, and anything ≥ 2^31 to ~1ms — so `Infinity`, the natural
  spelling of "no budget", bought an instant timeout, an immediate group-`SIGKILL` of a healthy child, and
  a `TimeoutOverflowWarning` on the host's stderr. Non-finite now means the longest budget `setTimeout` can
  hold (~24.8 days) — the only reading of "no budget" that is not a lie. `NaN` is **not** given that
  reading: "not a number" is a broken caller, and the safe failure for a broken budget is to expire at
  once, not to wait 24 days. Finite values clamp into `[0, 2^31-1]`, and a negative budget expires
  immediately because it already had.
- **On POSIX expiry, kill the process group — that, not the timer, is what releases the descriptors.**
  `detached: true` (`setsid`) makes the child a group leader, so `process.kill(-pid, "SIGKILL")` reaps the
  grandchildren still holding our pipes; the reads then hit EOF on their own. Abandoning reads instead is
  what pins Bun's event loop for the orphan's whole lifetime — measured at a 20s hold against an unref'd
  400ms timer, and ~1.4 descriptors leaked per stall. Reaping the group instead leaves nothing resident:
  no surviving grandchild, no descriptor growth, and the host free to exit.
- **The exit path never kills the group.** The grandchildren there are healthy and deliberate — an `ssh`
  `ControlMaster`, a credential-cache daemon — and killing them would cost the user their multiplexed
  connection or their cached credentials for a call that *succeeded*. The readers are cancelled instead.
- **`setsid` drops the controlling terminal — a deliberate trade, not a free win.** A child can no longer
  open `/dev/tty` to prompt, which is what turns issue #209 from a 55s wait into an immediate
  `Permission denied (publickey)` for most users; `SSH_ASKPASS` is unaffected (no-tty is exactly its
  trigger), which is why the caller's budget still has to be sized for a human at a dialog. **What it costs
  is real:** the CLI entrypoint is a `thinkrail` bin launched from a terminal that stays in the foreground, and
  a user sitting there could until now *see* `ssh`'s `Enter passphrase for key …` on `/dev/tty` (ssh reads
  the tty directly, so our piped stdio never hid it) and type it. They no longer can. Accepted because the
  UI is a browser client and a hidden terminal prompt is not a flow it can ever show, wait on, or report —
  a fast legible failure beats a prompt only the launching shell can see. It also puts the child outside the
  host terminal's signal group, so the budget — never a `Ctrl-C` on the host — is what ends a stalled call.
  Surfacing the passphrase request in the UI (#209's headline ask, as opposed to its "at minimum" clause)
  stays unbuilt and needs the cancellation seam `dialog` wants above.
- **Windows children are hidden, not detached.** `windowsHide: true` with `detached: false` preserves a
  nonvisual console for ordinary descendants to inherit. Detachment removes that console: the immediate
  child stays hidden, but a helper it launches can allocate a visible console. This is why a focus-triggered
  `gh` lookup could still flash `tzutil`, Git, and SSH windows despite hiding the direct child. Windows
  does not support the POSIX group-kill path; expiry still terminates only the direct child, not a promised
  whole tree. Non-detached children participate in libuv's normal job lifetime; this runner is for bounded
  host-owned work, not independently surviving daemons. The native Windows regression uses a no-console
  driver, the real runner, and an ordinary console grandchild, with a detached positive control. It checks
  native console ownership/window state rather than option presence, output success, or browser DOM.
- **The env defaults to the live `process.env`, not the launch-time snapshot** — `boot`'s
  `resolveShellEnv()` repairs `PATH`/`LANG` by mutating `process.env` *after* startup, and a child spawned
  from the snapshot silently misses that repair. Both halves are pinned separately — a caller's `env`/`cwd`
  arriving at the child, and a post-startup mutation being visible to one spawned without `env` — because a
  test that only asserts the defaults cannot tell the two apart.
- `stdin` is always `ignore`, and both output streams are always piped and **read from the moment of
  spawn**; text is decoded incrementally and byte stdout is accumulated without decoding — an undrained
  pipe is how a chatty child deadlocks. The readers are
  cancelled once the outcome is decided *and* the grace above has run, never before it. Every
  timer is `unref`'d, so a bounded wait never holds shutdown open, and `waitedMs` comes from
  `performance.now()`, so a clock adjustment cannot render a negative wait.
- **Neither stream is capped.** `runBounded` accumulates whatever the child writes for as long as the
  budget allows, so a caller's byte ceiling (`git`'s 2000-char `boundedStderr`) bounds what reaches a
  client, never what this module holds in memory. Adequate for `git`/`gh`/`glab`, where the worst case is a
  progress log measured in hundreds of KB; a caller that can spew unboundedly needs a `maxBytes` option
  here rather than a truncation after the fact.
