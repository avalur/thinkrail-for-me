## Responsibility

The wire and composition root: `Bun.serve` HTTP+WS, static SPA serving, the WS method→handler registry,
channel fan-out, and the process-boot wrapper both launchers share.

## Boundary

- **Owns:** `server.ts` (async `createServer` first asks auth to start Central artifact watching and publish
  the initial current PI runtime, falling back to plain PI with closed `load-failed` state when needed, then creates
  `Bun.serve` with `/health`, `/ws` upgrade, a
  **`GET /files/<workspaceId>/<relpath>`** route streaming a worktree file's raw bytes from `Bun.file`
  after classifying only its bounded 8 KiB head (via `fs`'s `resolveWorktreeFile` — path-contained; bad
  id/escape/miss → 404; `Cache-Control: no-store`, because the worktree moves under the URL) so the
  markdown viewer's relative `<img>`s resolve, the sibling
  **`GET /blob/<workspaceId>/<oid>/<relpath>`** route serving that path's bytes **at one commit**
  (`git.readBlobStreamAtAsync` behind a 40/64-hex `oid` — a diff range's `resolvedOriginalOid`, so the URL
  names immutable content and answers `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`; the Git
  primitive requires a blob, so trees/commits/gitlinks are 404 alongside a bad id/oid/escape/absent
  path). Before opening a blob body, the route performs a bounded `git cat-file -s`; objects above
  `BLOB_SIZE_LIMIT` (64 MiB — the size of the largest image, PDF or notebook a review surface renders
  in one piece, and the bound on what one `change.revert` receipt may pin) are refused with 413. An
  accepted blob is **streamed**: only its 8 KiB sniff head is awaited for the headers and the rest relays
  `git cat-file`'s stdout chunk by chunk, so concurrent image or PDF diffs cost pipe buffers, not blobs,
  of host memory; the body goes out chunked (a streamed body carries no `Content-Length`), a consumer
  that disconnects kills its `git` — through the body's cancel once it streams, and through the
  request's `signal` while the sniff head is still awaited — and the relay's own deadline is five
  minutes, so a slow reader stalls `git` on the pipe rather than racing the 55 s network budget. Both routes exist
  because `fs.readFile` and `git.diffFile` answer `""` for bytes they must not decode, so a byte-only
  resource is fetched over HTTP instead. Both derive `Content-Type` through the shared byte classifier plus
  filename fallback (falling back to `application/octet-stream`) and
  send `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`; active same-origin types (`text/html`,
  `application/xhtml+xml`, `image/svg+xml`) additionally receive
  `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox; default-src 'none'`, so direct navigation cannot execute repository
  script, static serving with
  `index.html` fallback, the `server.welcome` push, the **`?client=` page identity** read off the socket URL at
  upgrade (threaded to every handler as `RequestContext`; it addresses terminal output but no longer *owns*
  PTYs — see [[submodule-server-terminal]]) plus the `clientKey → socket` registry and the **replay-namespace
  retention timer** that outlives a reconnect (terminals are deliberately untouched by it); the
  **request replay cache** keyed by `(clientKey, requestId)` (the first frame
  owns one handler promise + its
  serialized response, a reconnect replay awaits/returns that same result, a mismatched duplicate is rejected,
  and reaping the client clears its cache — but **only once nothing is in flight**: an unresolved request
  outlives the socket grace window, since the page holds that frame until its *own* deadline (30 minutes for
  the folder picker) and replays it on reconnect, so `clearClient` declines and the reap re-arms rather than
  let the replay start a second execution of a handler that has not finished). **Nothing in that cache is ever evicted**, because a
  successful `send` says the bytes were queued, not that the page read them, and a socket that dies holding a
  reply is indistinguishable from one that flushed it — so any result dropped on the host's own initiative may
  be the one a replay is about to ask for. A result leaves only on the client's own word, via two frames handled
  here and never routed to a handler: `{ ack: [id] }` names responses it has **read** (the steady state), and
  `{ resume: [id] }` on each reconnect names everything it still considers **unresolved**, freeing all other
  settled results. `resume` is what makes receipts safe to lose — an ack can die in a socket buffer exactly like
  a response can, and nothing would ever re-send it, so each reconnect restates the whole truth instead of
  confirming the confirmations. Cost is bounded instead by **two hard limits, each enforced where its size becomes
  known**: the entry count on the way *in* — a full namespace refuses new ids (`RequestReplayOverflowError` → a
  normal `ok: false`) while still answering every id it holds — and the retained bytes on the way *out* of the
  handler, since a response's size is unknowable at admission (`fs.readFile` returns a whole file) and in-flight
  work weighs nothing, so an admission-time byte check would bound the count and nothing else. A result that
  would breach the byte budget is not retained: the entry stays as proof the work ran, so its replay fails
  (`RequestReplayUnretainedError`) rather than re-executing, and the response the caller was already sent is
  unaffected. Neither limit can cost exactly-once — one refuses work that has not started, the other keeps the
  record of work that finished and drops only its answer,
  the **`provider.login`** channel publish (the `auth` module's session-less login-frame bridge, wired like
  `pi.extensionUi`), the **`provider.changed`** invalidation broadcast after auth changes the Central status or
  current runtime generation (clients re-read status/models), and the `provider.*` handlers—including
  `provider.jbcentralQuota`, whose handler composes `settings`' enabled/interval values with `auth`'s closed
  cached read so the siblings never import each other—the
  **`watch` wiring** (inject the
  `workspace.fsChanged` publish callback into `watch` and inject `agent`'s project-skill path classifier so
  each capped batch carries independent `skillChange: none|detected|unknown` evidence; expose
  **`workspace.watchReady`** as the typed preflight that awaits a fresh watcher's conservative startup nudge
  before a web skill-loading flow
  captures its baseline and reports whether the watcher was already known ready (the client's replay-safe
  conservative fallback; its optional `prewarm` flag is forwarded into `watch`'s bounded prewarm-only tier,
  so pre-selection warm-ups never grow the watcher registry unboundedly); plus the **repo-metadata** callback (`setRepoMetaPublisher`) fanned out to **two**
  convergences for a git-metadata write in a watched worktree:
  `refreshUserOwnedWorkspace` (**re-sync a user-owned workspace's folder-truth branch** — host-mediated,
  since `watch` has no `workspaces` edge, and self-publishing through the workspace-lifecycle tee) **and** a
  pathless, skill-neutral `fsChanged` frame (`paths: []`, `truncated: false`, `skillChange: "none"`) so the
  clients' `HEAD`-relative reads
  (`git.status`, an `uncommitted`-scope diff tab) re-read when a terminal `commit`/`reset` moves a ref;
  the same publish also feeds the **fsNudge seam** (`fsNudge.ts`: `setFsNudgePublisher` +
  `nudgeBaseRefWorkspaces`), the host mediation the `git.prefetch` handler triggers when the app's own
  background fetch **moved** a remote-tracking ref — a write only the project repo's shared `.git` sees,
  invisible to every worktree watcher — fanning the pathless frame to each workspace of that project whose
  diff base is the moved ref (their branch-scope merge-base may have moved — the re-read is idempotent when
  it hasn't; everyone else stays asleep)
  without touching a worktree file; call
  `ensureWatch(workspaceId)` from the
  workspace-read handlers (`fs.*`, `git.status`/`git.diffFile`, `spec.graph`) — a read is the "a client is
  looking" signal; `stopWatch` in `workspace.remove`'s fast path beside `evictSpecIndex`;
  `stopAllWatches()` in `stop()`), `stopJbcentralRuntime()` and `cancelAllLogins()` in `stop()` before the
  socket close,
  an optional boot-time `openProject(projectPath)` (best-effort — a launcher convenience), the
  **analytics wiring** (`initializeAnalytics` at boot from launcher provenance, destination, and per-run
  additional-data suppression; startup grants the additional tier only when `analyticsEnabled &&
  analyticsConsentConfirmed`. After boot, the settings publisher still broadcasts every merged config but
  changes the analytics grant only when its successful applied update explicitly carries `analyticsEnabled`,
  so unrelated writes preserve the current grant and the dialog's preference prime can enable it.
  `analyticsConsentConfirmed` controls the web prompt lifecycle. Its unconfirmed on-prime may enable ordinary
  additional capture, but browser attribution starts only from confirmed-on state: directly after the final
  applied dialog update (the UI is ready), or for a saved choice only through the launcher's explicit
  `RunningServer.startAttributionClaim()` readiness signal after normal UI readiness. Revocation cancels the
  claim generation. Basic
  events remain on in human runs. Consent changes clear additional-event correlation so re-enabling cannot
  reconstruct pre-consent work; campaign-only enrichment is inactive while off and restored from its strict
  server record when on without retrying a consumed claim.
  `shutdownAnalytics()` remains a best-effort drain in `stop()` and awaited by graceful shutdown;
  every capture site lives here, including the existing basic events: `chat_started` in `session.create`, `message_sent` (via the
  local `trackSend(mode, text)`) after an **accepted** `session.prompt`/`session.steer`/`session.followUp`
  (`prompt`/`steer`/`follow_up`; skipped when contracts' `isControlMessage(text)` — the client's TODO
  wake-nudge rides the same methods and is not a user message; `session.answerQuestion` is a tool reply,
  not a message either),
  `provider_login` from the
  login-publisher tee's terminal `success` frames with the method (`oauth`/`api-key`) looked up from
  `loginAnalytics.ts` — the loginId→method map the `provider.loginStart` handler records (and
  `provider.loginCancel` clears; an unknown loginId tracks nothing, fails closed) — +
  a successful `provider.jbcentralConnect`→`applied` (failed actions never count) — per
  `submodule-server-analytics`,
  feature modules never track). Basic login/chat/send events add the closed auth category from their own
  session/login generation, never from a later global runtime; sends snapshot provider/auth before dispatch.
  Opaque-loader provider membership identifies Central without opening its auth/configuration surface.
  Additional setup/run/task/review/PR observations use the closed triggers in
  [[submodule-server-analytics]], with transient consent-scoped correlation and task-artifact reconciliation.
  Host alone mediates these events; analytics initialization emits the packaged-install lifecycle event,
  while no provider-change capture exists.
  Setup observes existing read results, never triggers provider work; only explicit setup mutations count.
  Run timing starts at canonical `agent_start`, with local send intent recorded before calling pi (not
  after `ackSend`); unproven provenance stays unknown and retries remain one cycle until `agent_settled`.
  Accepted queued origins survive send resolution until canonical cycle observation; rejected sends do not
  contribute. Consent clearing preserves pre-grant cycle markers, while settlement, queue clearing,
  session deletion and full host reset release their corresponding transient intent state.
  Task observation reads reduced group state synchronously through the existing pi-free `TodoStore` /
  `groupStatus` boundary before a completion-capable mutation, then reads artifacts after reconciliation;
  wire edits wait for existing artifact work rather than create new Git writes for telemetry.
  Completion evidence and deduplication wait for the workspace's existing reconciliation queue to converge,
  including replacement passes after plan drift, and retain the mutation's original consent grant.
  Empty/newly-hydrated groups and completion by deletion do not count. These memory-only observations
  retain a grant's capture before asynchronous work and never replay across revocation.
  `stop()` → immediate agent-session cleanup, then `persistTerminalSessions()` **before**
  `closeAllTerminals()`, then watcher/socket disposal; `shutdown()` memoizes one asynchronous graceful
  path: bounded `settleSessionsForShutdown()` + awaited `shutdownAnalytics()` first, then `stop()`). The
  bounded settle includes hidden delegation children even when their parent is
  idle, plus child cascades already started by a concurrent removal, so graceful quit does not let a
  background child lose its terminal abort/tool result; `crashLog.ts` (`installCrashLog` — the `uncaughtException`/`unhandledRejection` report
  appended to `<dataDir>/logs/crash.log` and echoed to stderr, then `exit(1)`: in-process pi means such a
  fault is the whole host's, and a launcher started without a terminal otherwise loses its only trace.
  Never a recovery, and never installed under `NODE_ENV=test` — a unit-test process reports its own
  faults. It renders the throw via the `log` module's `describeError`, so crash reports and log lines
  agree, but keeps its own sync append — the death path must not depend on the logger's state);
  `boot.ts` (`bootHost` → await `initLogging` — debug level when the launcher passed `verbose` — then
  install the crash report, resolve the login-shell PATH, pre-warm the same Central watcher/runtime
  initialization before choosing the serving port, await `createServer` (which idempotently enforces
  runtime bootstrap for low-level embedders), and write the `listening on` info line (see
  `submodule-server-log`). Its
  SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers await that same shutdown before process exit. Settling aborts streaming sessions
  and waits bounded so pi persists their "Operation aborted" tool results and transcripts land paired,
  except a session blocked on `ask_user_question`: shutdown deliberately leaves that call dangling and the
  next attach repairs it to an answerable ack; explicit user Stop remains the terminal-abort path); `handlers.ts` (the WS method→handler
  registry, including `workspace.rename` as the direct manual door into
  `renameWorkspace(id, name)` (no `branch` option) — the workspaces module changes only the
  display label, persists, and publishes it, so the handler never mutates Git, emits, or patches a client
  separately. The host's `resolveNewChatModel` composes AppConfig settings with the agent's settled available
  model list and Pi thinking clamp; `model.default`, `session.create`, and newly-created review chats share
  that resolver, and creation passes its model and effort explicitly. A `session.create` that **named** a
  model and every `session.setModel` also record the resolved model as recent through `settings`'
  `noteRecentModel` — a default-resolved creation is the host's choice, not the user's, and is not
  recorded. `model.contextSettings` and `model.setContextWindow` delegate to agent's `modelContext`
  adapter and return its `ModelContextSetting[]`; the mutation names a provider/model target or all
  eligible pairs, never arbitrary model metadata, and successful saves reuse `provider.changed` to
  invalidate catalogs across clients. Existing review chats and plan-review
  subagents keep their own policies — and
  the **Skills-manager set**: `skill.list` / `skills.state` / `project.skills` build
  the admission context from `projects` (+ the
  workspace's `skillOverrides` when workspace-scoped) and pass it into agent's `listSkillCommands`/
  `listSkillCatalog`; `session.list` decorates agent's `listSessions` summaries with
  `openTodos: countOpenTodos(…)` per session (a host-only composition of `agent` + `todos` — `agent`
  stays todos-free; a failed count omits the field, never fails the list); **`todo.requestFix`** is the
  same kind of composition (`todos` records + renders the fix package, `agent` delivers): the package is
  fired **detached** into the item's own chat as a **structured `todo-review-fix` custom message** —
  `sendReviewFixToSession` (`fireTodoFixPrompt`), which calls `AgentSession.sendCustomMessage` with the
  rendered package text as `content` (what the agent reads) and `ReviewFixDetails`
  (`buildReviewFixDetails`: item id/title, the feedback note, and slim path/line-resolved findings) as
  `details` (what the chat card renders), `deliverAs: "followUp"` + `triggerTurn` — **not** a synthetic
  user turn (#363). Wrapped in `ackSend` exactly like the old `followUpSession` path, so a pre-turn
  rejection rolls the review record back (`rollbackTodoFix`) and surfaces as an extension-UI notice, so an
  undelivered fix request never strands as `changes_requested`.
  The manual fix package **carries the item's open agent findings** exactly like the automated cycle
  does (`itemFixFindings` — this item's unstale agent-authored drafts by `origin`, `markCommentsSent` +
  `buildSendPackage` under `withReviewLock`): with auto-fix off, the verdict path sends nothing, so
  without this the worker never sees the reviewer's findings and they strand as drafts under a later
  approve. Package rendering happens before those findings are marked sent; every preparation failure
  identity-checks and rolls back exactly the `changes_requested` record this request wrote, plus any
  marks, so it neither strands a failed request nor overwrites a newer decision. The same identity-safe
  compensation runs on detached pre-turn rejection;
  **`todo.remove`** layers a host-side guard in front of `todos`' own, together covering the item's
  full in-flight lifetime — neither alone does: `removeTodo`'s durable `pending` mark covers
  `startTodoReview` (synchronous, at start/enqueue) until the verdict clears it;
  `isItemUnderActiveReview(sessionId, id)` reads the in-memory per-item latches — the fix latch
  (`claimItemFix`) and `planReviewQueue`'s active set — and covers the tail `pending` misses: the
  verdict clears the durable mark, but the fix delivery that follows it is still in flight. The host
  injects that in-memory guard into `removeTodo`, and the queued removal evaluates it together with the
  durable guard immediately before deleting; checking before enqueue would leave a wait-behind-reconcile
  window in which a review could start and reach a verdict. A manual or automatic fix claims one
  in-memory per-item latch before its first await and remains part of that guard through package
  preparation and fix-send acceptance/failure; overlapping manual sends are rejected, and removing the
  item cannot send a captured fix package for a TODO that no longer exists;
  **`todo.startReview` / `todo.reviewAll` + `host/requestReview.ts`** compose the agent reviewer. A plan
  step is reviewed by a **hidden, ephemeral delegation child** of the plan session (`agent`'s
  `runReviewSubagent`) carrying OUR reviewer role — `host/reviewerRole.ts` owns the system prompt, the
  read-only tool set, and the fenced-JSON output contract; the review package `todos` renders is a change-set
  **reference only** and never names tools. The child returns final text, the host parses the structured
  verdict (`parseVerdict`, lenient on findings, strict on the verdict word) and owns every state
  transition. There is no reviewer chat, no reviewer-authored tools (`review_verdict` /
  `add_review_comment` / `reflect_finding` are gone with it), and therefore no reviewer session to
  monitor, register, or unstick — the whole crash-recovery surface those needed collapses into the
  awaited promise: a child that errors, aborts, or returns unparsable text rejects, and the `catch`
  clears the item's `reviewing` mark (`cancelTodoReview`) on the spot.
  **Two entry points, one recording path.** The worker's own `request_review` tool (`handleRequestReview`)
  awaits the verdict and returns it as the tool result — the worker reads `composeText` and fixes inline.
  The Start review / Review All buttons (`startPlanReview`) mark the item `reviewing` **synchronously**
  (so the panel shows the pulse the instant the client re-reads the plan) and deliver the outcome through
  the record + the Review tab. **Both** run the review body on the plan's serial chain
  (`planReviewQueue.onPlanChain` — the button path fire-and-forget, the tool path awaited), so a tool
  request never overlaps a button review of another step on the same plan. Both funnel into
  `recordVerdict`: `approve` settles the item (`approveTodoReview(…, "agent")`); `request_changes` files
  every finding into the Review tab (`fileFinding` — an inline comment when `reviews.anchorProblem`
  accepts the position, else review-level; anchor resolution is best-effort so a bad anchor falls back to
  a review-level comment, but a store-write failure propagates and cancels the review rather than silently
  dropping the finding while still spending the cycle) and then spends the fix budget.
  **The 1-cycle cap is the same on both paths.** `canAutoFix = reviewAutoFix !== false && spent < 1`
  (`todoReviewAutoCycles`), and the record is written with `autoCycles: canAutoFix ? 1 : 2` — `1` means
  "the worker was actually asked to fix, this item is mid-cycle", `2` is terminal ("the human decides
  now"). Recording `1` without asking anyone to fix would strand the item: `maybeAutoReReview`'s trigger
  reads exactly that value, and nothing would ever produce the fresh delta it waits for. **A cycle is spent only once the worker accepts the fix.** On the button path `deliverFixToWorker` owns
  the whole critical section — file the findings, record the optimistic cycle `1`, select and mark them
  `sent`, then send — with filing through mark held in one `withReviewLock` so no interleaved Review send
  can grab the just-filed drafts before reservation. Failure splits on whether filing completed: a *filing*
  failure throws before any record so the review cancels (`fileFindings` having compensated its partial
  persist), while any *post-filing* failure — a send rejection (worker detached, busy, pre-turn refusal)
  **or any preparation failure** (snapshot/package/mark) — re-records the item terminally (`autoCycles: 2`)
  on top of the optimistic `1`, alongside the `rollbackSend` that returns any marked findings to `draft`.
  A post-filing failure escaping as a throw would strand the item at `autoCycles: 1` — the whole point of
  the unified catch. Leaving `1` there would strand the step forever: nothing asked the worker to change anything, so
  no fresh delta can ever reach `maybeAutoReReview`, while a later manual review would read the cycle as
  spent and refuse to send. A claim the fix latch refuses (a manual Ask-to-fix already in flight) settles
  the same way. On the button
  path a live budget also **delivers the fix to the worker chat** (`deliverFixToWorker`): the item's
  origin-scoped draft findings (`itemFixFindings` — this item, this worker session, non-stale; an
  unscoped sweep would carry other steps' findings into this worker and strand them as falsely-sent) are
  rendered with `renderFixPackage` + `buildSendPackage` and sent as the structured `todo-review-fix`
  message under `ackSend`, with `rollbackSend` returning them to `draft` on a pre-turn rejection. The
  tool path never sends — the worker already has the verdict in its tool result, and a second copy as a
  message would double the instruction. With the budget spent or auto-fix off, both paths leave the
  findings in the Review tab for the user and say so (`composeText`).
  **One review at a time per plan** (`host/planReviewQueue.ts`): `onPlanChain` chains each run onto the
  plan's promise — `enqueuePlanReview` uses it for the detached button path, `handleRequestReview` awaits
  it for the tool path — so Review All starts N steps but runs them serially and a tool request queues
  behind an in-flight button review of a different step. N concurrent provider streams is what the chain
  exists to prevent. The same module holds the per-item claim both entry points check, so a step already
  under review is refused rather than reviewed twice with two verdicts racing onto one record. `todo.reviewAll` reports `{ total }` — the count it actually started — and `alreadyRunning`
  only when it started nothing while the plan's chain is still busy. The module is pure mechanics with an
  injected runner (no agent dep), which is also how `planReview.test.ts` drives the whole verdict →
  record → deliver path without a provider.
  **Auto re-review** (`maybeAutoReReview`, tee'd off the reconcile hook on `isTodoToolEnd`): after a fix
  lands and the worker re-marks the step done, exactly the items still inside their one auto cycle
  (`autoCycles === 1`, not `reviewing`, `status: "done"`) get re-reviewed. The trigger accepts either a
  fresh commit delta on a `changes_requested` record OR a record reset to `unreviewed` — the latter is
  the path-list fallback (`todos/artifacts.ts` drops the record when the redo can't be committed), where
  a surviving spent cycle is itself the "a fix landed" signal, there being no sha to watermark against.
  An eligible item is **enqueued onto the plan's serial chain even when another review is already running**
  (a fix landing while Review All reviews a different step), and the per-item claim dedupes — it must not be
  dropped when the chain is busy, or a step fixed mid-review would stay `changes_requested` at
  `autoCycles: 1` forever, since nothing retries once the chain drains.
  **An `approve` never settles an item that still has open findings.** The two rounds of a fix cycle are
  independent runs, so nothing structural connects round 2's approve to round 1's findings: the gate is
  explicit, `itemOpenFindings` checked before `approveTodoReview`. Its set is deliberately WIDER than the
  fix candidates — `itemFixFindings` is `draft`-only (a `sent` finding must not ride a second fix
  request), while the review model counts **both `draft` and `sent`** as unresolved, since a worker that
  fixed the code without calling `resolve_comment` left the finding open. Without the gate the plan reads
  ready-to-ship and Open PR lights up over a comment the Review panel still shows as blocking. The
  **inverse also holds, a `changes_requested` verdict must not outlive its findings:** both human paths
  that close a finding reconcile via `clearChangesRequestedIfResolved` — `review.commentDelete` (deletion)
  and `review.commentUpdate` (resolve/dismiss). When the closed finding was the item's LAST open one
  (`itemOpenFindings` empty) and the item is still `changes_requested`, its verdict record is dropped
  (`dropTodoReviewVerdict`) back to `unreviewed` — ONLY the record: an in-flight review's pending mark
  (its start-SHA watermark) and the auto-cycle count stay, so closing the last finding mid-review/fix can
  neither watermark commits the reviewer never saw nor reset the one-cycle cap; the check is a no-op while any finding stays open, so a
  whole-change verdict that never had an inline finding is never touched. The agent's `resolve_comment`
  path (`applyAgentResolution`) is deliberately NOT reconciled here — it lands inside a fix cycle whose
  following re-review re-derives the verdict, and the record is inert either way (the Open-PR gate counts
  open findings, not the record). The plan chip is host-derived
  from that record and `apps/web`'s `useChatTodos` re-reads the plan on any review-snapshot change. A blocked
  approve clears the `reviewing` mark, leaves the record alone, tells the worker to `resolve_comment`
  what it addressed (`composeText`'s third shape) and rides the wire as
  `PlanReviewResult.blockedByOpenFindings` so the card cannot claim the step is done. `resolve_comment`
  stays the WORKER'S tool — `reviews.applyAgentResolution` only resolves a `sent` comment, and only when
  the calling session equals the chat `markCommentsSent` recorded it as delivered to;
  `project.setTrust`
  acknowledges the aliases present at grant via agent's
  `listProjectAliasSkillNames`; `project.acknowledgeSkills` / `project.setSkillEnabled` /
  `project.setGroupEnabled` / `project.aliasSkills` / `workspace.setSkillOverride` mutate/read the persisted
  toggles; `session.reloadResources` re-scans a running session — the composition stays here; `agent` never
  imports its sibling. `createServer` also wires **`setSkillAdmissionResolver`**, mapping a session's
  `workspaceId` → its project's trust/acknowledged/disabled + that workspace's overrides (fail-closed), so
  `agent` gates skills without importing `projects`/`workspaces`). The sibling subagent policy is composed
  here the same way: `createServer` wires `setSubagentsEnabledResolver` to map an explicit
  `Workspace.subagentsOverride` when present and otherwise use `AppConfig.subagentsEnabled` (unknown
  workspace fails closed), the settings
  publisher asks `refreshSubagentTools()` to reevaluate all live sessions after a global update that
  carries `subagentsEnabled` (likewise `refreshAgentReviewTool()` for `agentReviewEnabled`) — not after
  every publish, since `recentModels` now publishes on each model switch and a tool-set rebuild per idle
  session would be pure churn — and
  `workspace.setSubagentsOverride` persists through `workspaces` then refreshes only that workspace. The
  two authoritative publishers remain the clients' convergence path; the host-to-agent refresh changes
  runtime capability, not frontend state;
  **Review marks are memory-plus-disk, and only the disk half survives a restart.** The serial chain and
  the per-item latches are in-memory; `pending` marks are a disk sidecar. `createServer` calls
  **`reconcilePendingReviewsOnBoot`** once, before the server accepts connections: it walks every project's
  every workspace and calls `todos`' `clearAllPendingReviews(worktreePath)`, which sweeps every session's
  sidecar and drops every `pending` entry unconditionally — safe because nothing has been enqueued in this
  fresh process yet, so every mark found necessarily predates it. Without this, a review in flight at the
  last shutdown would spin `Reviewing…` forever and Review All would skip the item forever (its own
  `reviewing !== true` filter);
  `ackSend.ts` (the send-ack policy — see "Get right"); `titleTool.ts` (the **`set_title` host**, installed through agent's `setTitleToolHost` — the
  composition of `agent` + `workspaces` only the host may make). The main agent names things; the host
  only enforces the write policy (the old host-driven passes — first-words, then a cheap-model refine on
  the first settled turn, then a send-time cheap-model chat title — kept producing names users wanted to
  fix):
  - The calling session must be a live managed session (`getSessionWorkspaceId`); anything else — e.g. a
    subagent child — gets an error result.
  - `chat_title` → `renameSession(…, { onlyIfUnnamed: true })`. `workspace_name` → only when the workspace
    is managed (not `default`/`external`) and not `renamed`, via `renameWorkspace(id, name, { branch })`
    (locks it, moves the branch once). There is no branch-shape gate, so records an older host's
    provisional pass left unlocked are still nameable.
  - The result text states, per target, whether it was applied or kept because it was already named, so
    the agent stops. A `branch` without a usable `workspace_name` is rejected before any write (the slug
    would otherwise be silently dropped while the agent believes it is done), and a call that names only
    the chat while the workspace is still nameable says so, so the agent completes the pair. The first name is final, and a manual rename always wins.
  - `workspaceNeedsName(sessionId)` uses the same eligibility rule (managed, not `renamed`), so agent's
    turn-start `pending-naming` reminder and the write policy can't disagree.
  - A target the agent never names stays unnamed; there is no fallback.
  - The **workspace-archive teardown** — the other composition of `agent` + `terminal` + `workspaces` only
    the host may make. `workspace.remove` **rejects a `kind: "default"` workspace loudly, before any
    side-effect** (the record's `worktreePath` is the project folder — the reclaim's `rm -rf` fallback
    must never see it; the UI hides Remove, this guard is for buggy/rogue clients). Otherwise it
    reaps *everything* rooted in the worktree (for a user-owned `kind: "external"` one, everything except
    the checkout itself) but is **non-blocking**:
    it does the fast part synchronously — `forgetWorkspace` (drop the record → gone from `workspace.list`
    immediately) → `evictSpecIndex` (drop the spec cache) → `closeWorkspaceTerminals` (kill its PTYs) —
    **acks**, then runs the slow reclamation in the **background** (`archiveTeardown`, fire-and-forget):
    `removeWorkspaceSessions` (abort a streaming turn, dispose the live sessions, **and** purge pi's
    on-disk transcripts for the cwd) → `reclaimWorktree` (`git worktree remove`; a hard no-op for an
    external one). So the user never waits
    for the git subprocess + session abort. **Ordering holds:** terminals (sync) and sessions (bg, before
    the reclaim) are down before the dir is deleted, since they hold it as cwd, and the workspace's
    todo-mutation queue is settled (`settleChangeArtifacts`) between the two — an in-flight reconcile's
    plan/baseline writes land before the reclaim that sweeps them, never after it into a resurrected dir. Best-effort by contract —
    a failed background teardown is warn-logged, never thrown into the void (nothing awaits it). **Archive keeps the branch but not the chat:** the git branch stays (code is
    recoverable), yet chat history is purged with the worktree — a deliberate scope choice, not a leak.
- **Change mutations are serialized per workspace, on their own chain** (`reviewLock.ts`'s
  `createKeyedLock` mints both): `change.revert`/`change.undo` run under **`withChangeLock(workspaceId)`**
  so two reverts cannot interleave their load→verify→write passes, while reviews and changes —
  independent resources — never queue behind each other. The agent is deliberately **not** paused: the
  `changes` module's compare-and-swap makes the race safe, and the fs watcher's `fsChanged` tick re-reads
  the open tabs after a write exactly as it does after an agent edit (so both handlers `ensureWatch`
  first). The named failures travel as `WsResponse.errorCode`
  (`STALE_VIEW`/`SCOPE_IMMUTABLE`/`RANGE_INVALID`/`RECEIPT_UNKNOWN`/`UNSUPPORTED_CHANGE`) through the same `CodedError`
  mapping `UNKNOWN_COMMIT` uses — the dispatch names no codes of its own, so a code added in `contracts`
  and thrown by a feature reaches the client with no host-side allowlist to update.
- **Review state is host-composed and serialized per workspace** (`reviewLock.ts`): `review.send*` is
  `reviews` (drafts + package) plus `agent` (session) plus `reviews` again (mark sent + link) — a
  check-then-mark straddling an `await createSession(…)`, the review layer's only non-atomic gap.
  **`withReviewLock` covers every review mutation the WIRE exposes, not just sends**, because two different things fall
  into that gap: a second *send* reads the same "drafts, no session yet" and forks the review, and a
  *mutation* invalidates the package already built — a `review.close` Clear landing there strands the
  package: the mark sees a fresh empty review and links the chat to *that*, leaving comment ids
  the agent can never `resolve_comment`. One queue per workspace, so a mutation issued mid-send simply
  happens after it.
  The package prompt is fired **detached** after the mark, so the lock only ever holds session
  creation, and a failed operation releases it rather than poisoning the queue. The plan-review verdict
  path joins the same lock: `deliverFixToWorker`'s file→record→select→render→mark pass stays under it, so
  a Clear or an interleaved send cannot replace or grab the candidate ids between those stages. Deliberately unlocked: `review.get` (its load → re-anchor → persist is one synchronous pass,
  and hydration must not queue behind a send) — plus the two mutations that remain fully synchronous,
  `reviews.resolveCommentFromAgent` (the worker tool seam) and `reanchorWorkspace` (the fs-watch tee):
  both re-read the snapshot from disk before writing, and neither removes a comment nor closes the
  review, so landing in a send's gap can't invalidate the package's ids.
- **A review send lands in the conversation already on screen, else the key's chat.** Both send
  handlers route through `sendToFileChat`: comments are grouped by `reviews.reviewSessionKey` (the
  anchor's path, or the review-level bucket for anchorless remarks — pinned like a file so a second
  overall remark continues one discussion), and each group lands, in order of preference, in the
  client's **last open chat** (the optional `sessionId` the send carries — the conversation the user
  is already in), else the key's pinned chat (`reviews.fileReviewSession`), else a NEW chat; whatever
  received the package becomes the key's pin (`markCommentsSent`), so the sidebar's "open the
  discussion" always follows the comments. **`review.sendBatch` answers with every session it touched**, in group
  order: a batch spanning two files starts two chats, and naming only the first left the other one
  running unseen while its comments already read as sent (the client opens them all, focusing the
  first). A linked chat that is merely **detached** is
  treated as present: it is `agent.ensureSessionAttached`ed from the persisted transcript and followed
  up into. Review state and pi sessions both survive a host restart, so gating on liveness alone
  (`hasSession`) meant any review chat no client had reopened got a *second* chat and an overwritten
  link. A new session is created only when the file never had one — or, logged as an explicit
  recovery, when the transcript is genuinely gone from disk (there is no UI to close a review and
  start over, so wedging it would be worse); every other re-open failure throws rather than silently
  forking the conversation.
- **Scratch-dir seeding on chat start:** the `session.create` handler calls `workspaces`'
  `ensureWorkspaceScratchDir` before creating the session — the Default workspace's gitignored
  `.thinkrail/context/` lands in the user's repo only when a chat actually starts there (and a
  worktree's deleted scratch dir self-heals). Host-composed — no new module edges.
- **Project lifecycle fan-out:** `createServer` installs the `projects` module's publisher and maps every
  authoritative open/reopen/close snapshot to **`project.updated`**. The WS `open` handler subscribes to
  that channel and hydrates two views in `server.welcome`: `projects` (open records only) and
  `recentProjects` (all known records). The one full-snapshot channel is idempotent and avoids separate
  opened/closed streams replaying out of order. Every client converges its rail + Recents from it; only
  the initiating open flow selects Project Home, while a close fallback remains per-client view state.
- **Workspace lifecycle fan-out:** `createServer` installs the `workspaces` module's publisher
  (`setWorkspacePublisher`), mapping each domain event `kind` → its `WS_CHANNELS.workspace*` channel
  (`created`/`updated` → the full record; `removed` → `{ projectId, id }`) and `server.publish`ing it. This
  is the **single** place workspace membership changes reach the wire — create/rename/archive all flow
  through it, so every client (including the initiator) converges by reacting, never by per-client optimism.
  The two new channels are `ws.subscribe`d in the WS `open` handler alongside `workspace.updated`.
- **Session-deletion fan-out:** `createServer` installs the agent module's deletion publisher and
  broadcasts each workspace-scoped `SessionDeletedPayload` on `session.deleted`; the WS `open` handler
  subscribes every client so permanent domain deletion converges beyond the initiating page. It remains a
  low-latency event, not a durable queue: a reconnecting client's active-workspace `session.list` is the
  authoritative read-side repair for an event missed while its socket was down.
- **Chat Resources:** the scoped resource read, command output/stop and direct-child stop/stop-all
  handlers enforce each request's exact key set before resolving workspace membership and passing ids plus
  the registry-owned cwd to the agent barrel. Parent/child ids follow Pi's canonical session grammar
  (including internal dots); workspace and command ids retain their owner-specific grammar and authority.
  Missing parents/resources use `RESOURCE_UNAVAILABLE`; output's missing-command result is
  `available:false` only after validating its parent. No client path/PID field is accepted.
  The agent's resource publisher maps to `session.resourcesChanged`, subscribed in the WS open handler;
  this is a catalog invalidation, never an output broadcast. Resource ownership and teardown stay in agent.
- **Session-state composition:** before serving, the host supplies every workspace `{id,cwd}`, initializes
  lifecycle/receipt metadata, and installs the workspace→project resolver. `session.stateList` returns the
  complete all-workspace snapshot; `session.state` broadcasts full records; completion acknowledgement and
  nudge handlers validate workspace/session identity through the same registry. The WS open handler
  subscribes every client after welcome. `session.activityList` remains an inert `[]` compatibility method
  for one window and has no push channel.
- **CLI update lifecycle:** a launcher may supply one optional asynchronous notice producer, fixed interval,
  and parameterless update runner. `createServer` starts checks after listening without awaiting them and never
  overlaps checks. A newer release becomes the retained `available` snapshot in later welcomes. The v70
  `host.update` request acknowledges after starting one detached, server-single-flighted run; running,
  succeeded, and failed are full replacements on `host.updateAvailable` for every client. Success latches until
  host restart and does not shut down or relaunch the unsupervised process; failure permits retry and exposes no
  child output or arbitrary diagnostic. Discovery failures preserve known state, shutdown makes late results
  inert, and the host never learns feed, installer, command, path, channel, or version selection.
- **Interview invitation delivery:** the three user-send handlers share one post-`ackSend` path that
  filters control traffic once, tracks anonymous `message_sent`, and records the local feedback count. The
  feedback module's injected publisher maps an eligible claim to addressed `feedback.interview` delivery
  for that request's opaque client key only when its socket-advertised protocol version supports the channel;
  delivery failure or final client reap after the reconnect grace releases the claim, while a transient
  reconnect retains and re-delivers it after `server.welcome`. A host restart has no claim to re-deliver, and
  the welcome clears the frontend's stale popup projection. Popup `feedback.respond` actions are ordinary
  replay-safe requests and never alter the Settings link.
- **Chat titles:** `session.rename` resolves `workspaceId` to its cwd and delegates title validation plus the
  unconditional durable write to `agent`; it never patches one client directly. Automatic titles come only
  from the agent's `set_title` (above); sends carry no naming work. Both manual and automatic
  writes converge every client through the existing `pi.event`/`session_info_changed` channel and
  `session.list` repair; no new push channel exists.

`RunningServer.startAttributionClaim()` is the explicit launcher-readiness signal and rechecks the saved
enabled/confirmed choice before entering analytics attribution.

- **Public surface (barrel):** `createServer`, `CreateServerOptions`, `RunningServer`, `bootHost`,
  `BootHostOptions`, `BootedHost`, `BuildKind`.
- **Allowed deps:** `contracts` (`PROTOCOL_VERSION`, feature-introduction versions, `WS_CHANNELS`); `shared` (`freePort`, `shellEnv` — for

  task snapshots, with group status still core-owned); the feature modules it composes (per the parent dependency graph, incl. `fs`'s
  `resolveWorktreeFile`/`resourceMeta` and `git`'s `readBlobStreamAtAsync` for the `/files` + `/blob`
  routes); Bun/Node.

## Get right

- Every registered WS command is debug-traced by **method name only** (`ws <method>` / `ws <method>
  failed`); a name absent from the closed handler registry is traced as fixed `ws unknown method` instead.
  Never trace raw unregistered method names, params, or handler error text, which can reflect credentials
  and user-supplied values; see `submodule-server-log`'s privacy rule.
- WS commands return values directly; only events + extension-UI + **`project.updated`** (published from
  the `projects` module's injected publisher) + the workspace lifecycle trio
  (`workspace.created`/`updated`/`removed`, published from the `workspaces` module's injected publisher) +
  **`session.deleted`** (published from the agent module's injected publisher) + **`provider.changed`**
  (published from auth's Central/runtime invalidation seam) + **`host.updateAvailable`** (published for each
  retained CLI-update lifecycle replacement) use push channels. Every
  **broadcast** push channel a client should hear must be `ws.subscribe`d in the WS
  `open` handler — a publish on an unsubscribed topic reaches nobody, silently. Four channels are deliberately
  **not** subscribed and not broadcast: `feedback.interview`, `terminal.data`, `terminal.exit`, and
  `terminal.detached` are sent with `ws.send` to one addressed client. Adding an addressed channel means
  wiring a publisher, not a subscription.
- The host is the single place features are wired together — features never reach back into it.
- Separate host processes do not coordinate mutable state or events. They may use the same data directory,
  but each owns independent in-memory sessions, terminals, watchers, and connected clients; persistence
  conflicts are accepted rather than serialized by the host.
- `shutdown()` is safe under concurrent signal/native-quit calls: callers receive one promise, lifecycle
  work runs once, and resource disposal remains ordered after session settling.
- **A send (prompt/steer/followUp/answerQuestion) is acked when ACCEPTED, not when the turn ends**
  (`ackSend`): pi's send methods resolve only at turn end, and a turn can outlive the client's request
  timeout (long tool rounds and multi-minute reasoning turns are routine) — awaiting completion would
  surface a phantom "request timed out" over a healthy turn. A rejection inside the ack window still
  fails the request (bad model / missing key; for `answerQuestion` also an unknown/answered/superseded
  call — `assessAnswerability`'s loud verdicts); later faults reach the client via the event stream.

### Drift & overwrite

A finding is anchored to `side:"worktree"` (the live file — it follows the code inline). When a *later*
plan step overwrites the reviewed lines, `reanchor` degrades it to `outdated` (`reviews.ts` reanchor),
but `maybeAutoReReview` triggers on SHA-watermark growth, or (the path-list fallback's equivalent, no
sha to watermark) the record reading `unreviewed` while a spent auto cycle still stands on record — see
`todos/SPEC.md`'s auto-cycle durability. The **derived `stale`** condition guards
this — `anchorState === "outdated"` AND the finding's origin sha superseded on its step
(`todos.reviewedShaSuperseded`). Every agent finding carries `origin` (step + session + reviewed sha,
stamped by `fileFinding` from the review the verdict belongs to); `isFindingStale` drops stale findings
from the auto-fix set. The client badge rides a **server-derived, non-persisted
`stale` flag**: `markClientStale` enriches every snapshot crossing to the client (`review.get` +
the `review.changed` broadcast) — the host is the only ring that can, since staleness joins a finding's
`origin` (reviews) to its step's commits (todos). `stale` is never a persisted field.

Preserving the *original* reviewed code was considered and rejected: reconstructing it after the
fact from `reviewedSha` is unsound (the finding's textQuote came from the add-time worktree, which is not
guaranteed to equal that blob), and add-time snapshotting is real storage cost for low value (a finding
whose code was overwritten is usually moot; its prose body survives regardless). If ever needed, the only
sound route is snapshot-at-add, never freeze-on-drift.

### Persisted delta (whole phase)

One optional persisted `ReviewComment` field carries finding provenance: `origin?: { todoId, reviewedSha,
sessionId }` — **landed**. The wire `stale?: boolean` is derived by the host per client snapshot, never
stored. No new tool parameter, no new `status`/`anchorState` enum value.
