## Responsibility

The server-synchronized app config: opaque fixed-theme selection, fixed/system mode and optional light/dark
pair, additional-analytics preference and first-run dialog completion marker, host-owned new-chat model and
effort defaults, terminal replay budget and Windows shell preference, chat composer growth preset, chat/file
visual line widths plus independent pane bounds, bounded custom layout-preset catalog, JetBrains quota
display/cadence, the host-wide subagent default, and plan-review policy. `defaultModel` / `defaultEffort`
select the defaults every new chat receives (unset model means first available; unset effort means medium);
`reviewModel` / `reviewEffort`
select the reviewer runtime (unset means that same new-chat default); `reviewAutoFix: false` records a `request_changes`
verdict and waits instead of auto-sending a fix. **`favoriteModels`** is the picker's starred list in display
order — a whole-list client write, validated as model-shaped entries and deduped by `sameModel`;
**`recentModels`** is host-owned: `noteRecentModel(model)` (called by `host` on an explicit `session.create`
model and every `session.setModel`) puts the model first, dedupes, caps at `RECENT_MODELS_LIMIT`, persists and
publishes, while a client-supplied `recentModels` in `settings.update` is dropped before validation so no
client can rewrite the host's record of what was chosen.
The module reads, normalizes, persists, caches, and broadcasts values that intentionally follow the owner
across frontends.

Current workbench frame, workspace resource placement, current/default preset selection, side/bottom group limits, selection, and focus are explicitly absent. Those are frontend-surface-local view state under [[submodule-web-shell-layout-state]]. Built-in layout presets remain web-owned.

A numeric setting is bounded by its consumer when that domain owns the safety cap—for example `terminal`
clamps `terminalReplayKb`, so a hand-edited config cannot exhaust memory. Settings validates the shared
40–240 line-width contract and custom layout presets because it owns their cross-frontend storage contract.
It also validates the global `jbcentralQuotaEnabled` boolean and whole `jbcentralQuotaRefreshSeconds`
interval (`1–3600`, default 30), because those values govern host process cadence across every frontend.

## Boundary

- **Owns:** cached current `AppConfig`; `getConfig()`; `updateConfig(partial)` (merge → validate known fields → persist → publish the merged `AppConfig` and successful applied `AppConfigUpdate`); line-width and resource-free custom-preset validation/normalization; custom-preset safety caps; `setSettingsPublisher`; and `resetConfigCache` for tests.
- **Public surface (barrel):** `getConfig`, `updateConfig`, `noteRecentModel`, `setSettingsPublisher`, `SettingsPublisher`, `resetConfigCache`, plus pure custom-preset normalization used by host startup after persistence load.
- **Allowed deps:** `persistence` (`loadConfig`/`saveConfig`); `contracts` (`AppConfig`, `LayoutPreset`,
  `isTerminalWindowsShell`).
- **Forbidden:** host or another feature sibling; current-layout document/snapshot types; workspace ids/resources; current frame validation; owning WS channels; or importing web preset definitions.

## Get right

- **Converge on broadcast, no client optimism.** `updateConfig` persists before replacing the live cache or publishing; a failed write changes neither runtime reads nor frontends. The publisher receives the full merged config for broadcast and the applied partial update so host consumers can distinguish an explicit field write from an unrelated merge. Every frontend, including the initiator, adopts `settings.changed`. `server.welcome` seeds the same cached value.
- `terminalWindowsShell` defaults to `"auto"`; persisted values fall back through persistence's shared
  `isTerminalWindowsShell` guard, while a wire mutation outside the closed shell union rejects the complete
  update before cache, persistence, or broadcast changes. Settings owns validation and synchronization;
  `terminal` owns executable resolution and spawning.
- `chatLineWidth` / `fileLineWidth` independently default to 120 and accept only finite integers from 40 through 240; their `Bounded` switches independently default to `true`. A malformed stored field falls back without discarding valid siblings; any invalid supplied field rejects the complete mutation before cache, persistence, or broadcast changes.
- `subagentsEnabled` defaults to `true` when absent so old config preserves current behavior; a present non-boolean update is rejected before cache, persistence, or broadcast changes. Settings owns only that global default; workspace override and effective-value resolution stay outside this module.
- JetBrains quota display defaults on and its interval defaults to 30 seconds when either stored field is absent/invalid. Wire updates reject a non-boolean flag or a non-integer/out-of-range interval atomically; they never clamp a caller's value into a different persisted choice.
- Theme availability/labels/palettes, operating-system appearance, and the effective theme are not server concerns. `theme` remains the opaque fixed choice; `themeMode` defaults to `"fixed"`, and `systemThemePair` remains absent until first use. A persisted pair is retained only when both slots are strings; malformed pairs are dropped, and system mode without a retained pair normalizes to fixed without replacing a valid fixed id. A missing/invalid mode also normalizes to fixed while an independently valid dormant pair may survive. Entering system mode requires a complete valid-shaped existing-or-incoming pair; a pair mutation replaces both slots atomically. Unknown ids remain persisted for each independently shipped frontend to resolve by required appearance.
- A `settings.update` carrying `theme` without explicit `themeMode` is a legacy-compatible fixed-theme action and sets mode to `"fixed"`. Thus an old client connected to a system-configured host can never appear to change only itself: its deliberate theme choice exits system mode through the ordinary persist-before-broadcast path.
- Retired host-layout and chat-message-order fields are ignored rather than persisted or broadcast. Layout instantiation and transcript order are frontend-local preferences.
- Custom layout presets are a complete top-level catalog replacement, not a nested per-item patch. Each value is bounded, resource-free, uniquely identified, uses only the current preset schema, and contains no workspace/tab/session/terminal identity. A malformed persisted member is isolated during config validation; a wire mutation with any malformed member is rejected as a whole. No alternate config key or old preset schema is read or upgraded.
- Deleting or editing a custom preset changes only the shared definition. It cannot mutate any frontend's instantiated frame or local default selection.
- Analytics preference and first-run dialog completion are validated booleans. The dialog may persist the
  default-on preference alone; a preference-only write never infers completion. Confirmation without a
  preference is rejected, and changing a confirmed decision writes both fields. The delivery gate belongs to
  [[submodule-server-analytics]]; the dialog lifecycle belongs to [[submodule-web-panels]].
- `null` clears optional `defaultModel`/`defaultEffort` and `reviewModel`/`reviewEffort` overrides; it is a wire-only sentinel and never persists.
- Stored `favoriteModels` / `recentModels` that are not arrays fall back to `[]` on load without discarding valid siblings; a wire `favoriteModels` with any non-model member rejects the whole update.
