## Responsibility

Read-only local GitHub CLI (`gh`) auth status for the New-Workspace dialog's "Connected" pill + Refresh
(and the Settings "Local GitHub" block). Shell-out only, server-side, on the host's resolved login PATH.

## Boundary

- **Owns:** `githubAuthStatus()` → `Promise<{ connected, login?, scopes? }>` by shelling `gh auth status`
  (parsing its report for the account + token scopes); `githubRefresh()` (re-shells the same check).
  Degrades gracefully — a missing / un-authed / non-responding `gh` all resolve to `{ connected: false }`
  so the dialog works fully offline. `THINKRAIL_GH_OFFLINE=1` forces the disconnected result without
  shelling (e2e drives the offline path). Also `ghSetupProblem()` → `Promise<GhSetupProblem | null>` — the
  *named* reason the direct gh path is unavailable (`missing` when `Bun.which("gh")` finds no binary or the
  probe never launched, `unauthenticated` when the probe exits non-zero, `null` when gh is usable or the
  offline seam is on). Both probes run the same `gh auth status` under `subprocess`' `runBounded` at an 8s
  budget (`GH_PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS`): `gh auth status` does a network round-trip, and the host is one event
  loop — a `spawnSync` here would freeze every session for the probe's duration, which is exactly the
  failure `runBounded` exists to rule out (see `subprocess/SPEC.md`). A probe that TIMED OUT reports `null`/
  `{ connected: false }` (a transient network stall is not "signed out" — the silent compare fallback,
  never the sign-in dialog). `pr` consumes `ghSetupProblem` (after a failed gh flow only) so the client can
  show setup guidance instead of silently degrading to the compare page.
- **Public surface (barrel):** `githubAuthStatus`, `githubRefresh`, `ghSetupProblem`.
- **Allowed deps:** `contracts` (`GithubAuthStatus`); `subprocess` (`runBounded`, the bounded child both
  probes spawn under); Bun (`which`). No `git`/`projects` reach — it's a pure `gh` probe.
- **Forbidden:** `host`; sibling features; being bundled into the browser (`gh` is shelled, never bundled).
