## Responsibility

A workspace is a `git worktree` on its own branch under the data dir — the anchor for files/git/terminals/
chats. Its **display `name` is decoupled from its git `branch`**: `name` is a human-readable label
(Title Case, spaces) and `branch` is a kebab slug derived from it — they were once held equal, and still
coincide for the auto `workspace-N` placeholder, but a named workspace carries both distinctly.

Two kinds are **user-owned** — ThinkRail uses their cwd but never renames or reclaims them. Every project
carries **exactly one built-in Default workspace** (`kind: "default"`) whose `worktreePath` is the project
folder itself (git's *main working tree*) — the "just work in my project folder" anchor, ensured lazily,
**non-removable and non-renamable**. Any **existing worktree** the user explicitly attaches is recorded in
place as `kind: "external"` — outside the data dir, never created or mutated here.

## Boundary

- **Owns:** `listExistingWorktrees(projectId)` (**async** — parses `git worktree list --porcelain -z` read
  through `gitAsync`, the same request-path-read rule `git/SPEC.md` states for `gitStatus`/`listCommits`:
  this is the Existing-Worktree dialog's populate call, so a slow/large registry must not freeze the host's
  event loop; drop the project folder, prunable registrations, and every path already represented in
  ThinkRail; branch-backed rows are `available`, detached-HEAD ones `detached`), `openExistingWorktree(projectId, path)`
  (**async** for the same worktree-list read; revalidate against
  the Git registry at the mutation door, comparing canonicalized paths; same-project retries are
  idempotent, cross-project cwd reuse is rejected; persist + emit `created` with `kind: "external"`, a
  directory-basename display name, `renamed: true`, and the repo default as its initial review target —
  **no Git or checkout mutation**), `createWorkspace` (**async**; off `baseRef` when given — branched with `worktree add -b`, never a detached
  remote checkout, and **`--no-track`**: a remote-tracking base would otherwise become the new branch's
  upstream (git's `autoSetupMerge` default), aiming the workspace terminal's `git push`/`git pull` at the
  *base* branch — the workspace branch's upstream is the user's to set on first push, never ours;
  off the repo `HEAD` otherwise; **remote-ref freshness is prefetched off this critical
  path** — the New-Workspace dialog `git.prefetch`es the base in the background, so create only `git
  fetch`es as a fallback when the local remote-tracking ref is missing entirely — that fallback runs
  via `gitAsync` (network must not block the event loop; bounding the wait and truncating the stderr are
  the runner's job, not this call site's) with the branch passed after `--`, and **a fallback fetch that does not land the ref
  fails the create**, naming the ref and carrying git's own stderr — including, when the remote simply
  never answered, the runner's own `timed out after <n>s …` in place of it. The configured remote is the
  longest matching prefix of the selected ref, because Git permits names such as `team/upstream`. The guard
  is the **ref**, not the exit code: a narrowed refspec (`remote add -t`, `--single-branch`, or an edited
  `remote.<name>.fetch`) can make `git fetch <name> -- <branch>` exit 0 without creating the expected
  `refs/remotes/<base>`, and keying off `!fetched.ok` let exactly that case fall through to the derived
  `fatal: invalid reference` this bullet claims to have removed. **The probe names
  `refs/remotes/<base>` in full**, exactly as `git`'s `prefetchBranch` does — a shorthand such as
  `origin/<b>` can also resolve a local branch literally named `origin/main`; the two sides of this race
  must ask about the same ref. **`worktree add` is handed that same full name**, not the shorthand: checking
  one ref and checking out another leaves Git's disambiguation to choose or reject the wrong object.
  `baseBranch` still records the user-visible `<remote>/<branch>`; only the revision handed to Git is
  qualified. **The message splits on the same distinction**: a fetch that *failed* carries
  git's stderr, while a fetch that *succeeded* without landing the ref names the refspec instead — its
  stderr is a progress log (`* branch release -> FETCH_HEAD`), so pasting it after "Could not fetch"
  showed the user a successful fetch as the reason a fetch failed. It is the step that knows *why*
  the base is missing, and discarding its result left `worktree add` to report the derived `fatal: invalid
  reference: <remote>/<branch>` — or, when the fetch never returned at all, nothing until the client's
  request timeout (issue #209). The ref is **re-checked with `rev-parse` before throwing**: a concurrent `git.prefetch` may
  have landed it while the fetch was in flight, and a create that would have succeeded must not lose that race;
  `Workspace.baseBranch` records **creation provenance** — the ref the worktree was cut from, which never
  moves afterwards (what the diff is measured *against* is the separate, re-pointable `diffBase`; see
  `setWorkspaceDiffBase`); **branch name made unique
  against refs *and* worktree dirs** — archiving leaves the branch behind and renaming frees a branch
  name whose worktree directory stays occupied, so candidate names skip both; path
  `dataDir/worktrees/<project-slug>/<branch>`; **seeds the ephemeral per-workspace scratch dir**
  (`WORKSPACE_CONTEXT_DIR`, with a self-ignoring `*` `.gitignore` — zero git footprint) in the
  new worktree, the home for temp docs (task-specs / working files) that stay out of git yet remain
  scannable by the spec tools (the path convention lives in `@thinkrail/shared/paths`; see
  [[submodule-workflow-skills]]'s artifacts rules); a **user-supplied name is the display name** (casing +
  punctuation preserved via `toDisplayName`; the branch is derived from it) and **sets `renamed: true`** at
  create — the user already chose, so automatic naming never touches it; auto-`workspace-N` leaves it unset,
  where `name === branch`; **re-reads the registry after the awaited fallback fetch** before appending —
  the pre-await snapshot is stale by then, and saving it would clobber a concurrent list's Default-ensure
  (same discipline as `renameWorkspace`'s re-load after its git subprocess)),
  `renameWorkspace` (**sync**; sets the sanitized, casing- and script-preserving display `name` and always
  sets `renamed: true`, so automatic naming never touches it again. **`opts.branch`** is the agent's English
  slug from `set_title`: when present, the branch becomes the slug's ASCII kebab form, clamped to 60 (the display name
  may be any script, so the branch is never derived from it), uniqued against refs + worktree dirs, and moved with
  `git branch -m`, while the **worktree dir never moves** (pi keys sessions and terminals/tabs by that exact
  cwd); a slug that sanitizes to nothing keeps the current branch. The branch-moving path re-points sibling
  records whose `baseBranch` or `diffBase` named the old branch, re-loads the registry after the Git
  subprocess so a concurrent removal is not resurrected, saves once, and emits `updated` for every changed
  record. Without `opts.branch` — the manual wire method — only the display label changes: `branch`,
  `worktreePath`, `baseBranch`, and `diffBase` stay untouched, no Git mutation runs, and one full-snapshot
  `updated` is emitted.
  **`name` and `branch` deliberately differ** after such a rename — the name is display-only and may repeat;
  the branch shown beneath it disambiguates (see [[submodule-web-panels]]). Unknown/default/external ids and
  invalid names still throw; callers decide presentation),
  `listWorkspaces(projectId, { includeDiffStats? })` (**async**; complete authoritative membership/order
  after Default ensure + user-owned folder-truth reconciliation — that sync prologue's load→mutate→save
  completes before the first await; the diff-stat badges then resolve **in parallel through `gitAsync`**,
  off the event loop, and **membership is re-read after the awaits** (the same stale-snapshot discipline
  as the writers): a workspace created while the badges resolved must appear in this response, because its
  `created` push may reach a client before this reply seeds that client's list, where a push into an
  unlisted project is deliberately not folded — a mid-flight row ships without stats until the next list.
  Cached stats attach to a fresh row **only when its diff-defining fields (`worktreePath`, `baseBranch`,
  `diffBase`) still match the snapshot they were computed from** — a `setDiffBase` landing while the
  badges resolved drops that row's badge the same way, never pairing the new ref with the old ref's
  totals. `workspaceDiffKey` is this identity's single public definition, shared with `reviews` so a
  review created across the same race retries against the new target instead of pinning the old one.
  Diff stats default **on** for compatibility, while `includeDiffStats: false` skips the per-workspace
  fan-out for cold navigation — an automatic reload on a shared host must not diff every worktree),
  `listWorkspaceRecords`
  (raw registry records without Default ensure, folder-truth reconciliation, or per-workspace git diffStats —
  for internal read-only paths like history scope mapping that must not block on git spawns) and its
  project-free sibling `listAllWorkspaceRecords` (every record, for host reads that must span workspaces
  without knowing which projects are open — the all-workspace `session.stateList` read),
  `workspaceDiffStats`, **`setWorkspaceSubagentsOverride(id, override)`** — persist `"on"` / `"off"`,
  or delete `Workspace.subagentsOverride` for `null` (inherit), then emit the authoritative full
  `workspace.updated` snapshot. It validates the closed value but never reads the global default or
  resolves effective agent policy; the host composes that across sibling boundaries;
  **`setWorkspaceDiffBase(id, ref | null)`** — re-point the ref this workspace's diff is
  measured against (`Workspace.diffBase`), `null` (or the creation base itself, which would be a redundant
  override) clearing it; persists + **broadcasts the updated record** so every client converges on the push,
  never optimistically (modelled exactly on `setWorkspaceSkillOverride`). Both **ref doors** — this one and
  `createWorkspace`'s `baseRef` — validate the ref's *shape* through the `git` module's `assertSafeRef`
  before it can reach a git argument (an option-shaped branch is reachable from any untrusted repo; see
  [[submodule-server-git]]). `createWorkspace` validates the **resolved** base *unconditionally*, not just a
  client-supplied one: with no base picked it comes from `rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`, i.e. from the
  repository, and an untrusted checkout can have an option-shaped branch checked out (`git branch` refuses such
  a name, `symbolic-ref` does not) — both halves of the same door, closed by one check. **The two base meanings are two
  fields on purpose:** `baseBranch` = where the branch came from (for a user-owned workspace, whose
  provenance isn't ours to claim: the repo default as its *initial* review target, never labelled `from`),
  `diffBase` = what its review is measured
  against; collapsing them would make a re-pointed target lie about provenance (the `branch · from
  baseBranch` receipt). Every read of "the base" resolves through the `git` module, never inline —
  `diffStats` composes the git module's **branch-scope range** (`resolveDiffRange` +
  `changedFileArgs(…, "--shortstat")`), so the workspace aggregate measures exactly what the Changes panel
  shows (merge-base semantics included — upstream commits on the base never inflate it) and reaches git
  bracketed by `--end-of-options` … `--` like every other rev this app passes. `diffStats` yields **no stats at all** (logged) when git couldn't
  answer, rather than a fabricated `+0 −0` — a failed read must not paint a dirty worktree as clean; the
  `Workspace.diffStats` field is simply absent, and `workspaceDiffStats` rejects,
  `getWorkspace` (by-id lookup, throws on unknown — anchors a chat session's cwd),
  and the **archive** primitives, split so the fast record-drop
  and the slow git reclaim are separable (the host archives off the request's critical path):
  `forgetWorkspace(id)` (drop the persistence record, return the removed record or `null` — gone from
  `listWorkspaces` immediately), `reclaimWorktree(ws)` (the slow half — `git worktree remove --force`,
  keeps the branch; hardened: rm + `prune` if git fails; **refuses both user-owned kinds and,
  defense-in-depth, any record whose `worktreePath` resolves to the project folder** — the rm-fallback must
  never see the user's repo or an attached checkout, however a corrupt/hand-edited record got there), and
  `removeWorkspace(id)` (the synchronous composition of the two, kept for callers/tests that want the whole
  archive in one call).
- **Default workspace (`kind: "default"`):** exactly one per project. `listWorkspaces` **ensures** it
  — find-or-create by `projectId`+`kind` (id a plain `randomUUID`; the `kind` field is the marker,
  never an id convention), **collapsing duplicates** defensively if out-of-band state churn ever
  produced two — and returns it **pinned first**. The in-list ensure is a **deliberate CQS exception**:
  the query performs a registry write + lifecycle emit so that *any* caller self-heals out-of-band state
  churn (backfills projects opened before the feature; the e2e reset rewrites `workspaces.json` mid-run)
  — the write is to the app's registry under the data dir, never into the user's repo. No `git worktree
  add` (the folder already is the
  main working tree) and **no scratch-dir seeding at ensure** — merely listing a project must never
  write into the user's repo (see `ensureWorkspaceScratchDir`). Fields are folder-truth, refreshed at
  list time when drifted — **emitting `updated`** so every client's rail converges instead of one tab
  staying stale after a terminal `git checkout` (`renameWorkspace` uses the same channel for the same
  fields; the store's merge triggers no re-list, so there's no feedback loop): `branch` = the
  folder's current HEAD (`symbolic-ref --short`, unborn-safe; detached → literal `HEAD`), `baseBranch`
  = the repo's default branch via `git`'s `resolveDefaultBranch` (unborn-safe — its last fallback is
  `currentBranch`, so the literal `"HEAD"` never persists) — so Default's Changes measure like
  any workspace, degenerating to uncommitted work when the folder sits on the default branch itself.
  Drift is **not** only a list-time discovery: `refreshUserOwnedWorkspace(workspaceId)` is the same
  re-sync **without** the diff-stat listing (an external workspace re-syncs only its `branch`, and an
  unreadable checkout is never persisted as a fake detached `HEAD`; unknown id / a managed workspace /
  no drift → no save, no emit), which the host wires to `watch`'s **repo-metadata nudge** (host-mediated,
  `watch` has no `workspaces` edge — see [[submodule-server-watch]]). So a `git switch` in the Default
  workspace's terminal converges the rail, the top bar and the empty receipt live, instead of leaving
  them on the old branch until a manual project reload — including a switch that leaves the working tree
  byte-identical (`git switch -c`), which writes nothing outside `.git` (`gitStatus` reads its header branch live for
  the same reason — see [[submodule-server-git]]).
  First materialization emits `created` (idempotent for stores); a drift-free list emits nothing. Every
  ensure emit — `created`, `updated`, the collapse's `removed`s — happens **after** the save, matching
  the module's persist-then-publish order everywhere else. **Non-removable + non-renamable,
  enforced here, not just hidden in the UI:** `forgetWorkspace` and `renameWorkspace` **throw** on
  `kind: "default"` — forget would hand the archive teardown's `rm -rf` fallback the project folder,
  rename would `git branch -m` the user's real branch; the record carries `renamed: true` so
  `set_title` stays away as belt-and-suspenders.
- **Initial-terminal provisioning is a durable host handshake.** Every workspace record first persisted by
  `createWorkspace`, `openExistingWorktree`, or Default ensure carries optional literal
  `initialTerminalPending: true`. `host` idempotently reserves the deterministic process-free terminal tab,
  then calls `completeInitialTerminalReservation(id)`, which clears the marker, persists, and publishes the
  updated workspace. Reservation failure leaves it pending for the host's boot/create recovery pass; success
  clears before any frontend placement. Only records created by the current code receive the marker; records
  without it are treated as complete and never backfilled, so an upgrade cannot resurrect a default terminal
  the user previously closed. No layout revision participates.
- **`ensureWorkspaceScratchDir(ws)`** — idempotent seed of the gitignored `WORKSPACE_CONTEXT_DIR`
  scratch dir (mkdir + self-ignoring `*` `.gitignore`); the host calls it on **session create** for
  every workspace, so the Default workspace writes into the user's repo only when a chat actually
  starts there (worktree creation still seeds eagerly at create; this also self-heals a worktree
  whose scratch dir was deleted). Hardened, because in the Default workspace it runs against
  **repository-controlled content**: it **throws when the workspace root is missing** (an externally
  deleted worktree must fail the session loudly, not be resurrected as an empty non-git dir); it
  **refuses symlinked path components** (`lstat`, never followed — a malicious checkout can't redirect
  the seed outside the workspace); and the `.gitignore` write is **exclusive-create (`wx`) — only when
  the file is absent**: in the Default workspace that path is inside the user's own repo, where an
  existing (possibly tracked, possibly customized) file is theirs to keep, and `O_EXCL` never follows
  a (possibly dangling) symlink; seeding fills the gap, never overwrites (pinned by regression tests).
- **Lifecycle events:** every membership mutation — `createWorkspace` (`created`), `renameWorkspace`
  (`updated`, the agent's `set_title` included since it goes through it), `forgetWorkspace`
  (`removed`) — emits a `WorkspaceLifecycleEvent` through an **injected publisher** (`setWorkspacePublisher`,
  the same inversion `terminal`/`agent`/`auth` use; `null` in unit tests / the e2e reset → silent no-op).
  The module stays ignorant of WS channels: it emits a domain event (`created`/`updated` carry the record,
  `removed` carries `{ projectId, id }`) and the host maps `kind` → `workspace.*` channel. This makes the
  module the **single source of workspace lifecycle pushes** (the naming handler never pushes — rename
  self-publishes), so registry membership stays shared domain state across every client (architecture #9).
- **Public surface (barrel):** `createWorkspace`, `listExistingWorktrees`, `openExistingWorktree`,
  `listWorkspaces`, `listWorkspaceRecords`, `listAllWorkspaceRecords`, `forgetWorkspace`,
  `reclaimWorktree`, `removeWorkspace`,
  `workspaceDiffStats`, `workspaceDiffKey`, `getWorkspace`, `renameWorkspace`, `refreshUserOwnedWorkspace`,
  `completeInitialTerminalReservation`, `ensureWorkspaceScratchDir`, `setWorkspacePublisher`,
  `WorkspaceLifecycleEvent`, `setWorkspaceDiffBase`, `setWorkspaceSkillOverride`,
  `setWorkspaceSubagentsOverride`.
- **Allowed deps:** `projects` (repo lookup), `git` (the runner), `persistence`, `log`; `contracts`;
  `@thinkrail/shared/paths` (the scratch-dir path convention); Node.
- **Forbidden:** `host`; reaching into another feature's internals (use its barrel).
