## Responsibility

The review surface's write path: **revert one hunk or one file's whole change in the worktree**, and undo
that revert. Git and the worktree are the authority — a mutation names *what the user saw* (the scope, a
line span per side, a sha-256 per side) and this module re-derives the change from its own reads.
The platform decision behind it is [[architecture]] decision #19; the rules below are this module's own.

## Boundary

- **Owns:** `revertChange(params)` and `undoChange(params)` — load awaits (scope resolution plus the
  bounded historical-byte read) followed by a **synchronous verify→write/claim pass**, like the
  `reviews` module's snapshot passes; the per-workspace **receipt ring**; the whole-file semantics table
  below.
- **Public surface (barrel):** `revertChange`, `undoChange`, `RevertChangeParams`, `UndoChangeParams`,
  `forgetWorkspaceChanges`, `retainReceipts`.
- **Allowed deps:** `contracts` (`ChangeReceipt`/`RevertTarget`/`LineSpan`/`GitDiffScope`), `git`
  (`resolveDiffRange`, bounded `readBlobBytesAtAsync` + `readPathModeAtAsync`), `fs` (`resolveWorktreeFile` for containment, `classifyBytes`/
  `hashBytes`/`decodeText` for identity and textness), `persistence` (workspace lookup), `trash`,
  `@thinkrail/shared/codedError`, Node `fs`/`crypto`/`path`.
- **Forbidden:** `host`, `agent`, `reviews`; any write outside `fs`'s contained path; `unlink`.

## What a revert means

- **The scope is resolved once, through `resolveDiffRange`** — the single definition of what "the diff"
  is. Only a range whose modified side *is* the worktree is mutable; a `commit` scope is rejected with
  `SCOPE_IMMUTABLE` (there is nothing in the worktree it describes). The original side is read at the
  range's **`resolvedOriginalOid`**, not its ref, so the two reads of a load→verify→write pass cannot
  straddle a commit that moved `HEAD`.
- **Compare-and-swap on both sides, inside the lock.** `expect.originalHash` and `expect.modifiedHash`
  must equal the sha-256 of the two sides as *this* pass reads them (`null` = the path is absent, which
  is how "added" and "deleted" are expressed). Either mismatch is `STALE_VIEW` and nothing is written:
  the agent is not paused for a mutation, so CAS is the whole protection. An `uncommitted` scope's
  original side is `HEAD`, which a commit moves, so it is checked exactly like the modified one.
- **Hunk identity is engine-neutral.** A `range` target carries line spans on both sides, never a patch,
  because two client diff engines split hunks differently. The revert replaces modified lines
  `[start, start+count)` with original lines `[start, start+count)`; `count: 0` names an insertion point
  before `start`, which is what makes "delete the lines the change added" and "restore the lines it
  removed" the same operation in both directions. Spans are validated against *these* reads
  (`RANGE_INVALID`), never trusted.
- **Range reverts are text-only and never change a file's existence.** A byte-only side, or a worktree
  file that is absent, is `RANGE_INVALID` — the whole-file revert is the operation for those.
- **The line model is jsdiff's:** only `\n` terminates a line, a preceding `\r` remains part of that
  terminated segment, and a lone `\r` is ordinary content. This is the model that produced the client's
  `structuredPatch` spans, so the same span cannot address a different server line.
- **Line endings and the final newline follow the side the lines come from.** Restored original lines
  carry their own EOLs (a CRLF base stays CRLF); a line that stopped being the file's last line is
  re-terminated with the file's dominant ending, so an unterminated base tail spliced into the middle
  cannot glue two lines together. The pre-splice worktree's final-newline state is preserved unless
  **both** spans reach their respective tails; only then does the original's state win, because that tail
  is the base the user was shown.
- **Whole-file revert, by the file's status in the scope** (read from the two sides, not from a status
  word): present in both → write the original bytes (bytes, so binary files are covered); **absent in
  the original** (added or untracked) → rename the CAS-verified worktree file to a hidden same-directory
  claim, then move that claim to the OS trash; **absent in the worktree** (deleted) → restore the original
  bytes, creating missing parent directories. Undo uses the same claim before an inverse removes a file.
  The rename occurs in the synchronous verify pass, so a later agent write recreates the real path and
  cannot become the object an awaited trash helper removes. If trash fails, the claim is restored only
  while the destination is absent; a concurrent recreation wins, and the original claim is preserved as
  `.thinkrail-recovery-<ulid>` beside it with that absolute recovery path in the thrown error.
  `receipt.trashed` is the helper's absolute input path, so the file appears in the OS trash under its
  `.thinkrail-revert-<ulid>` temporary name. Absent on both sides is not a change and is refused. A
  *renamed* file reverts as its two halves — the new path trashes, the old path restores — because that
  is what the two sides of each path actually say.
- **Symlinks and mode-only changes are refused as `UNSUPPORTED_CHANGE`.** Worktree identity is read with
  `lstat`, and the original tree mode comes from `git ls-tree`; a symlink on either side is never followed.
  Equal bytes with a different mode are not a content revert and are refused. A whole-file restore
  applies the original Git mode (`100755` maps to executable permissions); a range keeps the worktree mode.
- **Writes are atomic**: a temp file in the same directory, the selected mode applied, then `rename`.
  A crash mid-write leaves either the old file or the new one, never a truncated one.

## Receipts

- Every mutation answers with a **`ChangeReceipt`** whose id is also the undo token. The host keeps a
  per-workspace ring in memory, each entry holding the path's **`before` bytes and mode** — restoring
  what the path held *is* the inverse of every operation here, so there is no separate inverse payload to keep in
  step. A trashed file is therefore undone by **writing its bytes back**, not by reaching into the
  trash, which no OS offers portably.
- **The ring is bounded twice** (`retainReceipts`): at most **20 receipts** and at most **64 MiB of held
  bytes** per workspace, evicting oldest-first, and the **newest receipt is always kept** even when it
  alone exceeds the byte budget — the Undo toast just shown must work. Twenty is more than a toast's
  8-second life can stack; 64 MiB caps what one workspace can pin in host memory at the size of the
  largest blob `/blob` will serve. `workspace.remove` calls `forgetWorkspaceChanges`, so a removed
  workspace pins nothing — and because removal is not serialized behind the change lock, `record`
  itself refuses to hold a receipt for a workspace the host no longer lists, so a revert that was
  awaiting the trash helper when its workspace disappeared cannot resurrect the ring. `retainReceipts`
  is exported as the pure policy so its bounds are tested without a 64 MiB fixture.
- `undoChange` CAS-checks the current worktree file against the client's `expect.modifiedHash` **and**,
  when both the receipt's `after` and the current file have a mode, against the receipt's `after.mode` —
  the inverse rewrites the mode too, and identical bytes under a newer executable bit are still a change
  the user did not see; a file re-created after a whole-file trash has no `after.mode` to compare, so there
  the client's hash alone decides, as before — then applies the inverse,
  then **consumes** the receipt and emits an `undo` receipt that is itself undoable once — so redo is the
  same operation, not a second mechanism. A refused undo (`STALE_VIEW`) or failed inverse leaves the
  receipt usable; every attempt re-runs `resolveWorktreeFile`, so a symlink introduced after the revert
  cannot redirect the inverse outside the worktree.
- **Receipts are host memory only**, lost on restart: the worktree is git-tracked and a trashed file is
  recoverable from the OS trash, so persisting them would add a data-dir format for a convenience those
  two already back. An id the host no longer holds — evicted, forgotten with its workspace, or lost to a
  restart behind a still-visible toast — is `RECEIPT_UNKNOWN`, never a silent no-op; the client treats
  it as information (reload, "can no longer be undone"), not as a failure.
- Receipt ids are ULIDs generated from Node crypto; ring order remains insertion order rather than being
  re-derived from the token.

## Get right

- **The client never sends content.** Params carry a scope, spans and hashes; every byte written comes
  from this module's own reads. That is what keeps a stale tab from clobbering the agent's work, and it
  is why the expectation hashes are mandatory rather than advisory.
- **A failed original read is never absence.** `git.readBlobBytesAtAsync` returns `null` only for Git's
  explicit path-absent diagnostic and throws every other failure, matching `git.diffFile`. That
  distinction is load-bearing because an absent original is exactly the input that makes a whole-file
  revert trash the worktree file.
- **Serialization is the host's job** (`withChangeLock`, a chain per workspace, separate from the review
  lock — see [[submodule-server-host]]). This module assumes it is not re-entered for one workspace; it
  does not assume the agent is idle.
