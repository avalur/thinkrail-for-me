## Responsibility

Cross-cutting runtime utilities used by the engine host and its launchers. Server-side only — never
bundled into `apps/web`. Exposed through explicit subpath exports, not a barrel.

## Boundary

- **Owns:** host-side runtime helpers that are neither engine- nor transport-specific.
- **Public surface:** `@thinkrail/shared/shellEnv` → `resolveShellEnv()`, `pathLooksComplete()`,
  `localeRepair()`;
  `@thinkrail/shared/freePort` → `findFreePort()`, `isPortFree()`;
  `@thinkrail/shared/startupMark` → the static recursive wordmark plus the pure responsive/ANSI renderer
  and interactive-output gate used by every launcher;
  `@thinkrail/shared/version` → the baked `{ version, channel, commit }` release identity shared by CLI,
  desktop, and host provenance (with a committed `0.0.0-dev` source default);
  `@thinkrail/shared/paths` → the worktree-relative path conventions (`WORKSPACE_INTERNAL_DIR`,
  `WORKSPACE_CONTEXT_DIR`, `WORKSPACE_TODOS_DIR`);
  `@thinkrail/shared/codedError` → `CodedError` + `errorCodeOf()`;
  `@thinkrail/shared/removeTree` → `removeTree()`, the retrying recursive remove every teardown of a tree
  a child process ran from goes through;
  `@thinkrail/shared/spawn` → `spawnSyncCaptured()` + `spawnSyncCapturedBytes()` + `spawnDetached()`, the
  hidden-child-process seam every console child the host or CLI launches goes through;
  `@thinkrail/shared/jbcentral` → the native Central CLI adapter: absolute executable/version/status
  probing; the minimum supported version and the global opaque PI-extension path; a one-directional auth
  verdict; an artifact-location watcher; `add pi` / `remove pi` / `login` / `update --install` actions; and
  the per-OS official install plan. It never edits PI model or credential configuration.
- **/spawn** — `spawnSyncCaptured()` (sync capture → `{ launched, exitCode, stdout, stderr }`),
  `spawnSyncCapturedBytes()` (the same launch and exit semantics with **`stdout` left as bytes**, for a
  caller reading binary child output the UTF-8 decoder would replace — stderr stays decoded text, since a
  diagnostic is only ever read as text) and
  `spawnDetached()` (fire-and-forget `unref`) over `Bun.spawnSync` / `Bun.spawn`, always
  `windowsHide: true`. Bun 1.4.0 maps that option to libuv `UV_PROCESS_WINDOWS_HIDE`; the seam prevents
  background console spawns from omitting it. The two bespoke bounded runners (`server/subprocess`
  `runBounded`, `jbcentral`'s version/quota runner) set it directly.
- **Allowed deps:** Bun/Node runtime (`@types/bun`); `contracts` **types** (`JbcentralInstall`, the wire shape `jbcentralInstall`
  returns — kept in the wire so the server can carry it to the card verbatim).
- **Forbidden:** importing `server` / `web` / any `pi` package; being imported by `web` (it carries
  Bun/Node code that must not reach the browser bundle).

## Contents

- **/shellEnv** — `resolveShellEnv()`: make the host's environment safe for the shells it spawns, because a
  GUI-launched host (Finder/Dock, launchd, a systemd unit, a container) inherits a stripped-down one. Three
  independent repairs, each applied only when needed:
  - **`PATH`** — ensure it is the user's full login PATH so the in-process agent's bash/tools find
    `git`/`node`/etc. Skipped when `pathLooksComplete()`.
  - **locale** — set `LANG` to a UTF-8 locale when *no* locale is configured at all (`LC_ALL`, `LC_CTYPE`
    and `LANG` all unset). Without one, bash/readline is **byte**-oriented rather than character-oriented,
    so one backspace over a multi-byte character (Cyrillic, umlauts, CJK) deletes half of it and desyncs the
    line. Only `LANG` is set, never `LC_ALL`, so a user's per-category settings (`LC_NUMERIC`, `LC_TIME`, …)
    survive.
  - **`SSH_AUTH_SOCK`** (darwin only) — when absent, recover the launchd ssh-agent socket via
    `launchctl getenv SSH_AUTH_SOCK` (3s timeout, never throws, no-op when launchd reports none).
    Without it both the host's own git pushes (`pr`) and every embedded terminal lose the user's
    ssh-agent: `ssh-add` inside a ThinkRail terminal answers "Could not open a connection to your
    authentication agent", and a key loaded in Terminal.app never reaches the host's push.

  All repairs land on `process.env`, which is what makes them reach *every* shell the host spawns: the PTY
  terminals copy it (`server/src/terminal`), and so does the in-process agent's own bash.
- **/freePort** — `findFreePort(preferred, host?)`: the first free port at or above `preferred`, so a
  host can pick an open port instead of colliding with one already running. `isPortFree(port, host?)`:
  the underlying single-port check.
- **/startupMark** — the launchers' one boot signature: a committed 42×20 `TR` silhouette built from a
  cyclic `THINKRAIL·` field, composed with the product identity, a caller-supplied honest status, and its
  resolved endpoint. At 72+ columns it is a right-hand lockup; from 42–71 it stacks, and below 42 it uses
  the identity/status alone rather than wrapping the artwork.
  Rendering is one synchronous write's worth of text: terminal-palette green + sparse bright signals +
  dim separators when ANSI is allowed, plain UTF-8 for `NO_COLOR`/`TERM=dumb`, and no mark at all for
  non-interactive stdout. The root dev runner calls it before spawning concurrent tasks (`starting`);
  the source/compiled CLI calls it after `bootHost` resolves the actual URL (`host ready`). SVG/image
  conversion is never a runtime concern.
- **/version** — the one permanent release-stamping seam. Source runs report `0.0.0-dev`; release CI
  overwrites this module in its throwaway checkout before building either artifact family so CLI
  `--version`, desktop package metadata, analytics, and `server.welcome.appVersion` cannot drift. It
  contains identity data only and has no launcher dependency.
- **/codedError** — `CodedError(code, message)` + `errorCodeOf(err)`: an error carrying a wire
  `WsErrorCode`, so a failure a client must react to *specifically* travels as a name rather than a string
  to pattern-match. It lives here because both ends of the seam need it and neither may import the other:
  the module that knows the failure throws it (today `server/src/git`, for a vanished commit scope) and the
  host's request handler reads it onto `WsResponse.errorCode`.
- **/removeTree** — `removeTree(path, options?)`: delete a tree that a child process ran from, and keep
  trying while the failure is one a short wait can resolve (`EBUSY`, `EMFILE`, `ENFILE`, `ENOTEMPTY`,
  `EPERM`, `EACCES`) — ten attempts with a linear 100 ms backoff by default. It exists because Windows
  releases executable handles asynchronously after a child exits, so a bare recursive remove of a
  smoke/e2e temp tree throws `EBUSY` *after* every assertion has already passed, and because **`rmSync`'s
  own `maxRetries`/`retryDelay` are inert under Bun** — nightly run 33166583594 threw `EBUSY` 252 ms after
  printing `installer smoke OK` under a policy that mandated seconds of backoff. `EACCES` joined the
  retryable set after nightly run 33949193053: the same not-yet-released handle surfaces as `EACCES` as
  often as `EBUSY` on Windows. The retry is teardown resilience, not error suppression: a tree still
  locked past the backoff throws, and a failure no delay can fix (`ENOTDIR`, …) throws on the first
  attempt. `options.remove` is the injected-remover seam the unit test drives; `attempts`/`delayMs` let a
  caller trade patience for speed.
- **/paths** — the worktree-relative path conventions ThinkRail owns, named once so current and future
  consumers agree (today: `workspaces` *creates* the scratch dir and git *ignores* it):
  `WORKSPACE_INTERNAL_DIR` (`.thinkrail` — the repo-local host-managed dir, today holding the ephemeral
  scratch, the intended home for future host files like a cached spec index; **not** hidden from the file
  tree), `WORKSPACE_CONTEXT_DIR` (its `context/` scratch dir for temp docs), and `WORKSPACE_TODOS_DIR`
  (`context/todos/` — the chat TODO plans, one JSON per session, so they're ephemeral with the rest of
  the scratch). The pi-free `pi-todos/core` can't import this package (it stays vanilla-`pi`-installable),
  so it keeps a local mirror of the todos path; this module is the host-side source of truth. Distinct
  from the *home* state dir `~/.thinkrail` (server `persistence`). (The `.gitignore` *body* the host seeds
  into the scratch dir — a lone `*` — is a one-off inlined at that call site, not a path, so it lives
  there, not here.)
- **/jbcentral** — the **single Central process/filesystem boundary**. It resolves Central by absolute path,
  parses a bounded `central --version` result into a compatibility verdict, exposes the
  global opaque artifact path (`~/.pi/agent/extensions/jetbrains-central.ts`, and the `~/.local/bin/`
  installer fallback) and existence only, and invokes only the reviewed argv: `status`, `quota --json`,
  `add pi`, `remove pi`, `login`, `update --install`, and `proxy start --ensure-updated`. Support is a
  **minimum version only** (`MINIMUM_CENTRAL_VERSION`,
  `1.4.0` — the first Central release carrying the native PI surface): anything at or above it is supported,
  lower versions require update, and malformed output is
  unsupported. There is deliberately **no upper bound** — a newer Central is assumed forward-compatible with
  the argv this adapter invokes, and gating on it would strand users behind every Central release.

  **Auth and proxy health are separate, one-directional observations from one status probe.** Until Central's
  requested JSON status surface ships, `central status` exits 0 across these states and emits styled
  presentation rows. The `Auth` verdict therefore trusts only its single negative marker: `not connected`
  means **signed out**, every other rendering of the row (account, licence, managed-server, or wording we
  have not seen) means **connected**, and a missing row or failed probe means **unknown**. The `Proxy`
  verdict similarly trusts only the exact stopped marker as **stopped**; running, missing, or unrecognised
  presentation collapses to **unknown/not-stopped**. Only those positively observed negative facts may drive
  a recovery demand. This is the only place presentation output is read, and the shared observation never
  returns raw text, port, PID, URL, account, licence, company, server details, or diagnostics. Swapping to
  JSON later remains internal to this boundary; every other command's output is still never parsed.
  The probe is expensive by Central's design (a proxy health check plus a network update check, ~1.3s, and one
  CLI analytics event per call), so `JBCENTRAL_STATUS_TTL_MS` bounds how long a caller
  may serve an observation before re-probing; nothing here polls.

  **Quota is a structured, numeric-only read.** `readJbcentralQuota()` resolves the same absolute executable
  and runs only `quota --json` with bounded stdout and a deadline. It parses JSON internally and admits only
  finite `tariffQuota.available` / `tariffQuota.maximum` values (numeric strings or numbers) as recurring
  `remaining` / `total`; all other fields are ignored. Invalid JSON/shape/amount, timeout, oversized output,
  launch failure, or non-zero exit becomes a closed reason. There is no text-output fallback and no cache or
  polling here. Raw output plus account, plan, used, top-up, refill, and diagnostic data are discarded and
  never returned, logged, or persisted.

  **A spawned login is not a started login.** `central login` drives its browser handoff from a terminal UI,
  so with no TTY it exits immediately and no sign-in happens — while the spawn itself succeeds. The launch
  therefore waits a grace period for an early exit and reports `launch-failed` on any non-zero one, so a
  caller can offer the command to run on the host instead of promising a browser that never opened. An
  immediate *zero* exit is Central's "already signed in" short-circuit and counts as launched; a flow that
  really started is still running when the grace elapses, because it is waiting on browser consent. The
  dependency seam exposes only the child's exit — never its output.

  **A timeout bounds the wait, not just the child.** Killing a child does not close a pipe its own
  grandchildren still hold open — and Central spawns a proxy daemon — so the deadline resolves the call
  outright rather than firing a kill and then awaiting the read. This is load-bearing because the version
  probe sits on the host's boot path: an unbounded wait there means no port, no UI, and no error to show.
  Version stdout is bounded in memory; action stdout/stderr is ignored. No child output is logged or returned, and only exit success plus safe
  postconditions map to a closed adapter outcome. `watchJbcentralArtifact(onChange)` observes only that
  reviewed location and reports invalidation events for add, remove, and replacement; it handles a not-yet-
  existing extension directory by re-arming from the nearest existing parent, and an existence-only poll
  repairs dropped add/remove filesystem events. It never opens or fingerprints the generated file. The caller
  debounces events and rechecks existence through the ordinary inspection API.

  **A directory event is not an artifact event.** `fs.watch` is per-directory, and the re-arm above means the
  watched directory is routinely an *ancestor* — when the artifact directory has not been created, the
  watcher may land on `~/.pi/agent`, pi's entire state directory. So invalidation is
  gated on the artifact itself: an event is forwarded only when it names the artifact entry inside the
  artifact's own directory, and named events from anywhere else (ancestor churn, a sibling extension) at most
  re-arm and re-check existence. Naming the entry — rather than stat-fingerprinting the file — is what keeps
  "replacement" observable without ever reading the generated artifact.

  **An event is classified against the watcher that emitted it, never the current one.** The watched
  directory is mutable state that re-arming changes, so a callback already queued by a watcher that has
  since been closed would otherwise be judged against its successor's directory — reading an ancestor's
  churn as an artifact replacement, or an artifact event as ancestor churn. Each `arm()` therefore binds its
  own directory and a monotonic generation into the callback it installs, and closing a handle retires that
  generation, so a superseded callback is dropped rather than reclassified.

  **An unnamed event is scoped, not uniformly trusted or dropped.** `fs.watch` may omit the filename, and a
  watcher error surfaces the same way, so `null` carries no information about *what* changed — only about
  where we were watching. On the artifact's own directory it is treated as a possible replacement: the handle
  is closed (it may be the dead watcher behind an error) and the caller is invalidated, because existence is
  unchanged for an in-place rewrite and the existence poll therefore cannot recover it. From an ancestor it
  falls back to existence only. That asymmetry is deliberate: trusting `null` from an ancestor would restore
  that livelock on any platform that omits filenames, while dropping it on the artifact directory would
  silently strand a stale Central runtime until restart.

  The cross-module liveness obligation and post-mortem live in [[central-integration]]; watcher mechanics are
  pinned by `packages/shared/src/jbcentral.test.ts`.

  The adapter deliberately has no migration path for the previous unpublished integration: it never reads or
  edits `models.json`, `auth.json`, backups, or any unrelated PI state.

  **Install guidance is per-OS and single-sourced:** `jbcentralInstall(platform)` returns the official host-OS
  plan carried to the card; a remote browser never guesses its own OS. **The server's `auth` module is the sole
  caller** and composes these host-local actions and watcher invalidations with `agent`'s runtime-generation
  seam.

## Get right (shellEnv)

- Runs **once at startup, before creating any `AgentSession`**.
- No-op on win32, or when PATH already contains a user dir (`/.nvm/`, `/homebrew/`, `/usr/local/bin`,
  `/.bun/`) — `pathLooksComplete()`.
- Else spawn a login shell `[$SHELL||/bin/zsh, -l, -i, -c, env -0]` (retry without `-i` on non-zero exit),
  5s timeout, parse the `\0`-separated entries, overwrite `process.env.PATH`. Never throws — on any
  failure it leaves PATH untouched.

## Get right (jbcentral)

- **Detect + invoke Central by absolute path (`resolveJbcentralBin`), never by bare command.** Pass the live
  `process.env.PATH` to lookup and retain the official `~/.local/bin` fallback, because a long-running
  host must see a just-installed executable without restart. **The fallback names the file each OS's
  installer actually writes** — `central.exe` on Windows, `central` elsewhere (`install.ps1` installs
  `$HOME\.local\bin\central.exe`) — while the PATH lookup keeps the bare name, since `Bun.which` tries the
  Windows executable extensions itself and refuses extensionless files there. An extensionless fallback on
  Windows can never match a real install, which is precisely the case the fallback exists for: Central
  installed from the in-app guidance while the host is already running with a stale PATH. Its unit test
  pins the exact path, never an `exists` stub that answers true for everything.
- **`~` is `USERPROFILE` on Windows and `HOME` everywhere else** — read from the live env, per platform, with
  `homedir()` only as the fallback. This is the *same* home pi resolves for `getAgentDir()`, which is the
  whole point: the adapter and pi must name one artifact. Two rejected forms, both real bugs:
  `env.HOME ?? homedir()` (the original) silently loses on Windows, where `HOME` is ignored by pi but *is*
  set by Git Bash to an MSYS path — Central would be installed and configured and ThinkRail would report
  `absent`; and plain `homedir()` cannot be redirected in-process under Bun, which resolves it **once at
  startup** rather than per call (Node re-reads it), so the tests and e2e/smoke hosts that redirect a home
  would silently read the developer's real one. The platform is an injectable dependency (`platform`), so
  both branches are pinned by unit tests on any host OS.
- **Confidential-source-informed, public-surface-only.** Tracked artifacts contain only reviewed argv,
  compatibility bounds, the opaque path, typed outcomes, and independently authored fakes. Never copy or
  paraphrase Central source/output, and never read, parse, hash, snapshot, copy, log, upload, persist elsewhere,
  or serve the generated extension.
- **No standalone PI dependency.** Central writes global PI configuration; ThinkRail loads its path into the
  embedded PI runtime, including when `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` points elsewhere and no `pi` command exists.
  Watcher events are hints only: every rebuild re-inspects version + existence, and in-app actions explicitly
  request the same rebuild after their postcondition, so a dropped/coalesced filesystem event cannot lose a
  state transition.
- **Never return or throw raw child/loader data.** Adapter errors are closed codes with no free-form child
  text. Quota success carries only recurring `remaining` / `total` numbers; the caller may report generic
  guidance only.
- **No legacy migration.** This is the first supported native integration; the adapter never touches prior
  provider overrides or maintains backup/rollback machinery.

## Get right (freePort)

- Detect occupancy by **probing with a TCP connect**, not by catching a bind error: `Bun.serve` does not
  report `EADDRINUSE` for a busy `localhost` port on every platform (it can share the port via
  `SO_REUSEPORT`), so a bind-and-catch check is unreliable. A refused connection means free.
- `findFreePort` scans upward from `preferred` (predictable: `24242 → 24243 → …`) and falls back to an
  OS-assigned ephemeral port if the whole scan range is taken.
