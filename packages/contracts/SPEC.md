## Responsibility

The browser↔host wire spine: the single source of truth for the protocol. Types-only, with the only
runtime exports being the WS method/channel constants, protocol/feature versions, the small config default,
and narrow cross-ring guards. The one package `apps/web` may depend on—which is what lets the UI ship independently
of the host.

## Boundary

- **Owns:** the wire — entity types, the `pi` event/message types (re-exported), the WS method & channel
  registries, and the protocol version. Including **`WsErrorCode`** — the closed set of failures the *host
  names* (`WsResponse.errorCode`, today `UNKNOWN_COMMIT`, `PUSH_AUTH_FAILED`,
  `RESOURCE_UNAVAILABLE`, and `SUBAGENT_TRANSCRIPT_NOT_FOUND` — the latter is
  `subagent.getTranscript`'s **permanent** miss, the
  signal that stops the transcript dialog's polling. A known child whose first transcript file is not
  written yet instead returns empty messages with its current status, so a live run remains pollable;
  transport blips stay plain-`error` transients worth retrying — and the four `change.*` outcomes a
  reviewer's UI must distinguish:
  **`STALE_VIEW`** (an `expect` hash no longer matches what the host reads → re-read the diff and
  re-offer), **`SCOPE_IMMUTABLE`** (the scope's modified side is a commit, so nothing in the worktree is
  being described), **`RANGE_INVALID`** (a span lies outside the side it names, or a range revert was
  asked of a byte-only resource), **`RECEIPT_UNKNOWN`** (an undo of a receipt the host no longer
  holds — the ring is 20 deep and dies with the process), and **`UNSUPPORTED_CHANGE`** (the selected
  change is a symlink or mode-only mutation that this byte-oriented write path deliberately refuses)), so a client can react to one specific failure
  instead of pattern-matching an error message. A failure earns a code only when a client behaves differently
  for it; everything else stays a plain `error` string. Expected method-specific outcomes remain typed method
  results rather than generic WS failures; no current-layout protocol exists.
- **Public surface (`index.ts`):** `export type *` of `piProtocol` + `domain` + `nativeClient` + `hubDomain`
  (`NativeUpdateState` / `NativeUpdateBridge` and `NativeWindowState` / `NativeWindowControlsBridge`, the
  optional shell-local desktop capabilities; `HubAccount`, `HubMessage`, `HubChannel`, `HubAgentTask`,
  `HubFilter`, `HubDashboardSummary`); the value re-exports
  `DEFAULT_CONFIG`, `THEME_MODES`, `isThemeMode`, `isSystemThemePair`, `normalizeThemePreference`,
  `JBCENTRAL_QUOTA_REFRESH_SECONDS`, `isJbcentralQuotaRefreshSeconds`, `isJbcentralConnected`,
  `SESSION_RENAME_PROTOCOL_VERSION`, `SESSION_TITLE_MAX_LENGTH`, `normalizeSessionTitle`,
  `LINE_WIDTH_COLUMNS` + **`isLineWidth(value)`** (the shared 40–240 integer contract for synchronized
  chat/file wrap columns), `MAX_HISTORY_LIMIT`, `MAX_HISTORY_QUERY_LENGTH`, `TODO_NUDGE_PREFIX` +
  **`isControlMessage(text)`** (the one shared reading of that marker — the client hides such sends on
  hydrate, the host skips them in the history index and does not count them as `message_sent`; both
  sides agree here rather than each re-deriving `startsWith`) + **`isRetriedAttempt(messages, index)`**
  (the one shared reading of pi's persisted-but-superseded auto-retry attempts — the client's hydration
  hides their turns, the host's history indexer skips their text; both consume the index slot so jump
  anchors stay aligned) from `domain`;
  `HUB_ACCOUNT_PROVIDERS`, `HUB_ACCOUNT_STATUSES`, `HUB_AGENT_TASK_STATUSES`, `HUB_CHANNEL_KINDS`,
  `isHubAccount`, `isHubAccountProvider`, `isHubAccountStatus`, `isHubAgentTask`, `isHubAgentTaskStatus`,
  `isHubChannel`, `isHubChannelKind`, `isHubDashboardSummary`, `isHubMessage` from `hubDomain`;
  **`isTranscriptMessageRole(role)`**
  from `piProtocol` (the one definition of which roles a transcript carries: the host filters
  `session.getMessages` by it *and* `history` counts `messageIndex` by it, so two copies differing by a role
  would silently shift every later jump anchor); `export *` (value) of `wsProtocol`
  (`WS_METHODS`, `WS_CHANNELS`, the typed maps, `PROTOCOL_VERSION`, and feature-introduction versions).
- **Allowed deps:** none at runtime. **Type-only** devDeps on `@earendil-works/pi-ai` +
  `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core`, imported **from their package roots** (type-only → erased at build).
- **Deployment obligation:** wire contracts describe host behavior and compatibility, never the launcher
  or deployment that supplies it. A feature's wire shape is shared by browser, desktop, and future clients.
  Separate type-only native client capabilities describe an optional shell-local bridge, not host WS
  methods: `NativeUpdateState` and `NativeUpdateBridge` carry update presentation and explicit local
  actions; `NativeWindowState` and `NativeWindowControlsBridge` carry the maximized/fullscreen snapshot and
  the minimize / toggle-maximize / close actions a frameless native window delegates to HTML controls. The
  same web bundle discovers these capabilities without importing a native SDK. An optional
  `HostUpdateNotice` carries a closed CLI-host update lifecycle; protocol-gated `host.update` is an empty
  request that can start only the launcher's pre-bound updater. The browser never supplies a command, path,
  channel, version, URL, restart, or feed authority.
- **Forbidden:** any *value* import of a `pi` package; **any** import (even `type`) of
  `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` (pulls `node:fs`); the pi-ai **provider / API subpaths**
  (`/providers/*`, `/api/*`, `/bedrock-provider`, … — they statically load the Node provider SDKs); and
  importing `server` / `shared` / `web`.

## Contents

- **piProtocol.ts** — `import type` re-exports from the pi package roots (type-only → erased at build):
  - `@earendil-works/pi-ai`: `Model`, `Message`, `UserMessage`, `AssistantMessage`,
    `ToolResultMessage`, `TextContent`, `ThinkingContent`, `ImageContent`, `ToolCall`,
    `AssistantMessageEvent`, `Usage`, `StopReason`;
  - **`WireModel`** = `Pick<Model<string>, "id"|"name"|"provider"|"contextWindow"|"reasoning">` **+ the one
    computed field `thinkingLevels`** (pi-ai `getSupportedThinkingLevels`, mapped host-side in `toWireModel`;
    client→host params carry it inert) **+ three optional picker-metadata projections** — `cost`
    (`{input, output}` list prices per Mtok, a subset of pi's `ModelCost`), `input` (accepted modalities) and
    **`auth`** (`WireModelAuth`: the provider's `ProviderAuthKind` plus pi's `detail` label — the same
    vocabulary `provider.status` reports, projected per model so a picker can say "plan" instead of a
    per-token price without the heavyweight status call) — optional because a host older than
    **`MODEL_PICKER_PROTOCOL_VERSION`** (v77) omits them; the shape a model takes **on the wire**
    (`model.list`/`model.refresh`/`model.default`, the `session.create` result + params,
    `session.setModel` params, `SessionSummary.model`). An **allowlist** of exactly what the UI renders, *not*
    an `Omit`: extension/provider `Model.baseUrl` and `headers` can carry routing credentials, and an allowlist
    **fails closed** — a future `Model` field (secret
    or not) is excluded by default. The host re-resolves the real `Model` from `{provider,id}` — so a client
    can neither read the secret nor inject a `baseUrl` for the agent to call (see the `agent` module SPEC).
    **`sameModel(a, b)`** is the one identity test — `{provider, id}` — every ring uses; no other field is
    identity, since name, context, prices and levels are catalog snapshots that may lag a refresh;
  - `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core`: `AgentEvent`, `AgentMessage`, `ThinkingLevel` (the
    `off`-inclusive one);
  - the local render union **`PiEvent`** — the real superset `AgentSessionEvent` lives in the Node-only
    `pi-coding-agent`, so it's **mirrored** here (the `agent_end.willRetry` + `agent_settled` /
    `queue_update` / `compaction_*` / `auto_retry_*` / `summarization_retry_*` /
    `session_info_changed` / `thinking_level_changed` members, plus `bash_execution_update` — mirrored
    for union fidelity only; the host never calls `executeBash`, so the UI never receives it).
    Every message an event carries (`message_*`, `turn_end`, `agent_end.messages`) is typed as
    **`WireAgentMessage`** — `TranscriptMessage` plus the `WireBranchSummary` / `WireBashExecution`
    mirrors — never pi-agent-core's `AgentMessage`. That type is `Message` plus whatever
    `CustomAgentMessages` augmentation the compilation happens to include: pi-coding-agent adds the
    custom roles only in Node builds, and pi-agent-core itself no longer adds them, so the same
    `PiEvent` would otherwise mean two different unions on the server and in the browser (where the
    custom-message guards narrowed to `never`).
    `agent_settled` is a host projection carrying the final attempt's reported terminal metadata
    (`stopReason` + optional `errorMessage`): `agent_end.willRetry` covers provider auto-retry only and
    is not an automatic-work terminal when compaction or a queued continuation follows.
    `compaction_end.result` is typed as **`CompactionEndResult`** — an allowlist mirror of pi's
    Node-only `CompactionResult` carrying exactly what the compaction notice renders
    (`tokensBefore` + optional `estimatedTokensAfter`); the host constructs this projection rather than
    casting pi's richer object wholesale, and wire data remains untrusted, so the reducer guards the field
    shapes rather than assuming them;
  - **`SessionEventPayload`** (`{ sessionId, event: PiEvent }`) — the `pi.event` push frame.
  - the cheap-win mirrors (declared in the Node-only `pi-coding-agent`): **`SessionStats`** + **`ContextUsage`**
    (tokens/cost/context bar — display only) and **`SlashCommandInfo`** + **`SlashCommandSourceInfo`** (the
    command autocomplete rows, returned by live `session.getCommands`, skill-only pre-session `skill.list`,
    and mapped prompt-template listings), and **`SkillCatalogEntry`** + **`SkillDecision`** (`load`/`untrusted`/`pending-ack`/
    `disabled`) — the workspace Skills manager's `skills.state` rows.
  - **`SessionSummary`** — a chat session as the host reports it for hydration (read side); `live`
    distinguishes an in-memory session from a disk-only one. A frontend hydrates locally placed sessions and
    lists the rest in chat history for explicit reopen. The optional **`openTodos`** (count of non-`done`
    items in the chat's TODO plan) is populated only by `session.list` (the host decorates via the todos
    module) for history/status presentation; absent = unknown, treated as 0. A live
    summary's optional **`lastSettlement`** retains the host-observed terminal (`null` = the live run is
    active or settled without an assistant) so reconnect can surface a final failure Pi removed from its rebuilt context; absent
    means this host process has not observed a settlement and the persisted transcript is authoritative.
    The optional **`queue`** (**`SessionQueueState`**: pi's pending `steering`/`followUp` texts plus
    `hasImages?: true`, the host's conservative aggregate over queued browser sends) rides a live summary
    only when non-empty — the hydration seed for the client's pending strip, since `queue_update` fires only
    on changes and a client attaching mid-run would otherwise never learn of messages queued before it
    connected. The same aggregate enriches projected `queue_update` events; image bytes never ride this
    read-side queue state. At the normalized-state protocol, optional **`state`** carries the same exact
    `SessionState` installed by the all-workspace snapshot/push, letting transcript hydration prove which
    completion it rendered without an attention-specific epoch. Destructive operations use the separate
    **`SessionQueueContent`** /
    **`QueuedMessageContent`** shapes, which return each drained message's text and optional images exactly
    once so the composer can restore complete content without making ordinary queue broadcasts heavy.
    `session.getMessages` returns `{ summary, messages }` (the transcript is
    **`TranscriptMessage[]`** — the pi-canonical `Message` union widened with **`WireCustomMessage`**, a
    type-only mirror of pi-coding-agent's Node-only `CustomMessage`, so extension-injected messages like
    the ask replies cross the wire, and with **`WireCompactionSummary`** (mirror of the Node-only
    `CompactionSummaryMessage`: `summary`/`tokensBefore`/`timestamp`), the resolved-context record of a
    compaction — pi places it before the kept tail and drops the summarized messages, so forwarding it is
    what makes the compaction boundary survive reload/reopen instead of rendering a transcript that begins
    mid-conversation. The summary reflects the now-live session after a disk re-open). The role universe a
    host may send is pinned by the runtime **`isTranscriptMessageRole(role)`** guard: the single source for
    the server's transcript filter and history index, whose alignment keeps a history hit's `messageIndex`
    valid against the client's `turnIdByMessageIndex` — a role added to one side but not the other would
    silently shift every later jump anchor.
  - **Chat titles** — `SessionSummary.title` remains the non-empty read
    projection (`Chat` while pi has no durable name). The additive `session.rename` mutation takes
    `{ workspaceId, sessionId, title }`, rejects a title whose trimmed single-line form is blank or exceeds
    `SESSION_TITLE_MAX_LENGTH` (80), and returns an ack; `SESSION_RENAME_PROTOCOL_VERSION` pins the
    mutation and controls to v66 so a newer client hides them against older hosts. The existing Pi event
    `session_info_changed { name?: string }` is the one live domain update for manual and automatic changes,
    and `session.list`/`session.getMessages` repair a missed event. No title source/provenance, uniqueness,
    workspace coupling, or new push channel crosses the wire; session ids remain canonical.
  - the **extension-UI frames** **`ExtUiRequest`** / **`ExtUiResponse`** — our wire shape for pi's in-process
    `uiContext` calls (`select`/`confirm`/`input`/`editor` round-trip; `notify`/`setStatus`/`setWidget`/
    `setTitle`/`dismiss` are fire-and-forget), carried on the `pi.extensionUi` channel.
  - the **`ask_user_question`** wire types — **`AskUserQuestionArgs`** (`AskUserQuestionItem` + `AskUserQuestionOption`
    — the latter carries an optional `recommendedReason` the card renders inline as a `Why:` line under the
    option: the questions the agent authors, what the tool card reads from the `toolCall` block),
    **`AskUserQuestionResult`** (`AskUserQuestionAnswer[]` + `cancelled`: the browser's reply),
    **`AskUserQuestionAckDetails`** (the tool result's `details` used only when restart repair closes a
    dangling live-blocking call before attach) and **`AskUserAnswersDetails`** + the
    **`ASK_USER_ANSWERS_CUSTOM_TYPE`** constant, **`AskUserAnswersMessage`** (the correctly-paired
    tag↔details shape the host's builder is compile-held to) and the shared **`isAskUserAnswersMessage`**
    guard (all in `wsProtocol`, the value-bearing half): an eligible live reply becomes the native tool
    result; a `length`/`error`/`aborted` assistant call is terminal and never answerable; after restart, the
    reply travels as an `ask-user-answers` custom message paired by `details.toolCallId`.
    `WireCustomMessage.customType` itself stays
    `string` — the namespace is open (any pi extension can mint custom messages and they all cross the
    wire), so strictness lives at the producer + the guard, which validates the details *shape* (wire
    data is untrusted — another process, possibly another protocol version). The capability
    is a **host-owned pi custom tool** (server `agent/askUserQuestion` — see its SPEC for the design
    rationale); the chat renders the questionnaire **inline** and replies via `session.answerQuestion`
    (correlated by the tool call id; rejected loud when the call is unknown/answered/superseded).
  - the **todo plan-review fix** wire types — the **`TODO_REVIEW_FIX_CUSTOM_TYPE`** constant,
    **`TodoReviewFixMessage`** (the tag↔details shape) + its **`isTodoReviewFixMessage`** guard (in
    `wsProtocol`), and **`ReviewFixDetails`** / **`ReviewFixComment`** (in `domain`): a plan-review
    verdict's fix request reaches the worker as a **structured custom message** (customType
    `todo-review-fix`) instead of a synthetic user turn (#363). The message `content` stays the rendered
    package text the agent reads; `details` (the item id/title, optional note, and slim path/line-resolved
    findings) is what the chat card renders — the host resolves each finding's `path`/lines from its
    anchor at send time so the client re-parses nothing. See [[submodule-server-todos]] +
    [[submodule-web-chat]].
- **domain.ts** — app entities: `Project` (git repo + unique `slug` + optional **`closed: true`** — the
  persisted open-rail membership bit; absence means open for backward compatibility, and closing never
  changes the project's id or deletes its workspace associations — plus the skill-trust fields **`trusted`**
  (the per-project grant), **`acknowledgedSkills`** (re-confirm-new — which committed aliases are OK'd) and
  **`disabledSkills`** / **`disabledGroups`** (project-baseline per-skill and per-group off — a group is a
  plugin, a source tier, or the special `@plugins`), which gate what its skills contribute; a workspace layers
  **`Workspace.skillOverrides`** (per-skill on/off) over that baseline;
  **`SubagentOverride`** (`"on" | "off"`) + optional **`Workspace.subagentsOverride`** let a workspace
  force subagents on/off, while absence inherits the host's `AppConfig.subagentsEnabled` default;
  "does it have specs?" is **not** a field — it's the lazy `project.hasSpecs` query, since it's a full-tree
  walk), **`ProjectPathStatus`** (a
  candidate path's kind — `repo` / `initable` / `missing` / `notDirectory` — so the UI opens, offers a
  `git init`, or shows an error), `Workspace` (git worktree; its
  optional **`renamed`** flag is the naming lifecycle — absent = **not yet named** (a fresh `workspace-N`, or a
  record an older host's provisional pass left unlocked), so the agent's `set_title` may still name it; `true` = named (automatically or by the user), never auto-touched
  again; its optional **`kind: "default"`** marks the built-in per-project **Default workspace** — the
  project folder itself as a workspace, exactly one per project, pinned first in `workspace.list`,
  non-removable and non-renamable server-side; **`kind: "external"`** marks an explicitly attached,
  user-owned worktree ThinkRail may forget but must never rename or reclaim; absent = a ThinkRail-managed
  worktree workspace; optional literal **`initialTerminalPending: true`** is the host-owned provisioning
  marker carried only while a workspace still needs host reservation: the host reserves the deterministic
  terminal then clears it; absence means no provisioning work remains—explicit wire fields, never id
  conventions),
  **`OpenBranchReview`** (the optional open review reference for the active branch: PR vs MR + number; no status/actions),
  **`ExistingWorktreeCandidate`** (a `workspace.listExisting` row: absolute `path` + `branch`, or a
  `detached` row the chooser disables),
  `FileNode` (file-tree node),
  **`ResourceMeta`** (what a resource's bytes *are*, host-decided and pinned by
  `RESOURCE_META_PROTOCOL_VERSION` = v75: sha-256 `hash` + `byteLength`, both `null` when the resource is
  absent; `text` = valid UTF-8, BOM-aware, and not claimed by a recognized binary magic number (an ASCII
  PDF is a byte-only document; an SVG is text); optional `mime`, sniffed from magic bytes first and the
  filename second. It rides `fs.readFile` and both sides of `git.diffFile`, whose `content` is `""`
  whenever `text` is false and whose `originalOid` is the resolved range start used to address the immutable
  `/blob` side — the host refuses to send a decoded binary, so a client renders byte-only resources from the
  `/files` + `/blob` HTTP routes and uses `hash` as the identity a comment anchor or a revert expectation names),
  the **change-mutation types** — **`LineSpan`** (1-based inclusive; `count: 0` names an insertion point
  *before* `start`), **`RevertTarget`** (`file` = the path's whole change in the scope, or `range` = one
  hunk as **line spans on both sides**, never a patch or a `@@` header: two client diff engines split
  hunks differently, and the client must never dictate bytes) and **`ChangeReceipt`** (the answer to a
  `change.*` call *and* its undo token: `kind` revert/undo, the `before`/`after` hash+length+mode identity with
  `null` meaning absent, and optional `trashed` — the absolute same-directory temporary claim path the
  trash helper received for a whole-file removal; the file consequently has that temporary name in the
  OS trash),
  `Git*`/diff types — incl. **`GitDiffScope`** (what the Changes
  panel is diffing: `branch` → the workspace's work since diverging from its diff base (the range starts at
  their merge-base, never the base's tip) / `uncommitted` → worktree vs `HEAD` /
  `commit` → one commit, `sha^` vs `sha`; omitted on the wire = `branch`, so an older client is unchanged),
  **`GitCommit`** (a commit row of the scope menu's list), and **`BranchList`**: `remote` remains the
  canonical full-ref string list, while optional host-authored `remoteGroups` carries each configured
  remote and its `{ ref, branch }` rows for two-layer presentation. The field is additive so a newer UI
  falls back to full refs against an older host; a `null` remote group preserves tracking refs whose
  configuration was removed without inventing ownership in the browser. The two meanings of a workspace's base are
  **two fields**: `Workspace.baseBranch` is *creation provenance* (the ref the worktree was cut from — what
  the receipt's `branch · from baseBranch` shows; for a **user-owned** workspace, whose provenance isn't
  ThinkRail's to claim, it is the repo default as the *initial* review target and the UI shows no `from`)
  and the optional **`Workspace.diffBase`** is the *review
  target* (`workspace.setDiffBase`); every read resolves `diffBase ?? baseBranch` **server-side, in one
  place** — collapsing them into one field would make a re-pointed target lie about where the branch came
  from; **`ProviderStatus`/`ProviderStatusReport`**
  — the auth-provider status rows the Welcome strip renders (per-provider `configured` + auth `kind`:
  oauth / api-key / env / central / other — never credential values; `central` marks a built-in provider
  whose registration the JetBrains AI (Central) extension replaced, derived from registration identity
  alone, never from Central's configuration; plus `canOAuth`/`canApiKey`/`canLogout`,
  which gate the strip's in-app Sign-in / Sign-out affordances — `canLogout` is true only for a removable
  auth.json credential, false for env / runtime / models.json auth the host can't unset); the **in-app login wire** — **`LoginFrame`** (the streamed
  flow updates: `authUrl` / `deviceCode` / `select` / `prompt` / `progress` / `success` / `error`, which
  **accumulate** client-side, never a credential value), **`LoginPush`** (the `provider.login` frame,
  `{ loginId, providerId, frame }`) and **`LoginReply`** (`{ loginId, value }` — the browser's answer to a
  `select`/`prompt`); the JetBrains AI wire (protocol v43) — **`JbcentralStatus`**, nested on
  `ProviderStatusReport`, is the closed host-authored lifecycle: `absent`, `outdated`, `supported`,
  `configured`, `malformed-version`, `probe-failed`, `configuring`, or `load-failed`. Auth rides as a
  **`signedOut` flag on `supported`/`configured`**, and configured status also carries the closed
  **`proxyStopped`** observation; neither is a state of its own because credentials, proxy process health,
  and configuration are independent axes. Both flags are *positively observed negative
  facts* — unavailable or unreadable probes report `false`, so a client never renders a recovery demand the host did not
  substantiate. No proxy port, PID, URL, status text, or diagnostics cross the wire. Only
  parseable safe versions, closed probe/failure reasons, and the current action appear where relevant.
  `configuring` covers both a reviewed CLI action and the coalesced candidate rebuild for the newest watched
  artifact state; `configured` means the **current runtime for new work** applied that artifact.
  `load-failed.configured` says whether the latest observed global state requested Central, so the client can
  offer the closed Retry/Disconnect actions without receiving an artifact path. Historical live sessions may
  retain an older runtime and are deliberately outside this status. **`JbcentralInstall`**
  carries the host's per-OS `{platform,shell,command}` official install plan. **`JbcentralActionResult`** is
  the closed `applied` / `failed` union; failure reasons distinguish installation, version probe/support,
  Central action, artifact postcondition, and closed runtime-load failure without carrying messages. There
  are no pending, restart, blocked-session, recovery, migration, compensation, or reattachment outcomes. Raw
  stdout/stderr, generated extension content or paths, proxy URLs/secrets, diagnostics, affected-session ids,
  and raw PI models are structurally absent; server and web map codes to their own generic copy). Protocol
  v59 adds **`JbcentralQuotaSnapshot`**, the separate closed quota read: `hidden`, `available`, `stale`, or
  `unavailable`; only available/stale carry finite recurring `remaining` / `total` numbers and an observation
  timestamp. No account/plan/used/top-up/refill field or raw failure text exists;
  the **theme/config selection** — **`ThemeId`** is an open string on the wire, because the host persists
  opaque selections while the independently shipped web client owns the available manifest catalog;
  **`ThemeMode`** is the closed `"fixed" | "system"` behavior and **`SystemThemePair`** carries one opaque
  light id plus one opaque dark id. `AppConfig.theme` remains the reversible fixed choice in both modes;
  `AppConfig.systemThemePair` is absent until system mode is first configured, then survives returns to
  fixed mode. Effective appearance never crosses the wire: every system-mode client resolves the same pair
  against its own operating-system color scheme. `THEME_SYSTEM_PROTOCOL_VERSION` pins this to v58.
  These fields are additive on purpose: replacing `theme`
  with a nested object would break old clients (or create two fixed-theme authorities), while encoding a
  pair inside the opaque id would turn a simple id into an unvalidated mini-protocol. A later web client
  hides the controls against an older host using that feature-introduction constant;
  **`ComposerGrowthLimit`** (`"compact" | "roomy" | "half-chat"`) is the closed, server-synced composer
  height preference: 6 visual lines, 10 visual lines, or 50% of the mounted chat panel respectively;
  `"half-chat"` is the default, and the web owns translating these semantic ids into geometry;
  **`LINE_WIDTH_COLUMNS`** owns the shared `{ min: 40, max: 240, default: 120 }` integer contract for
  the independently bounded chat/file visual wrap columns; **`isLineWidth`** is the one validator consumed
  on both sides of the wire;
  **`SUBAGENT_SETTINGS_PROTOCOL_VERSION`** pins the global/workspace controls to their v57 wire
  introduction so a later web client hides them against an older host without comparing against the moving
  latest protocol; **`JBCENTRAL_QUOTA_PROTOCOL_VERSION`** likewise pins the v59 quota read + settings;
  **`WINDOWS_SHELL_SETTINGS_PROTOCOL_VERSION`** pins the v62 Windows-shell setting so a later web client
  hides it against a host that can preserve but cannot apply that config field;
  **`PLAN_REVIEW_SUBAGENT_PROTOCOL_VERSION`** pins the v67 review reshape — the reviewer chat is gone, so
  `TodoPlan.reviewerSessionId` and `ReviewComment.reflection` left the wire, `todo.startReview` returns
  a bare ack, and its detached failure arrives on the additive `review.failed` push (`ReviewFailedPayload`)
  since the review has no chat to carry it. An older client reads the dropped fields as absent, so the pin
  is what lets a client tell "this host has no reviewer chat" from "this host is older" rather than inferring it;
  **`AppConfig`** (`{ theme, themeMode, systemThemePair?, analyticsEnabled, analyticsConsentConfirmed, terminalReplayKb,
  terminalWindowsShell, composerGrowthLimit, chatLineWidth, fileLineWidth, chatLineWidthBounded,
  fileLineWidthBounded, customLayoutPresets, defaultModel?, defaultEffort?, reviewModel?, reviewEffort?,
  favoriteModels, recentModels, reviewAutoFix, agentReviewEnabled, subagentsEnabled, jbcentralQuotaEnabled,
  jbcentralQuotaRefreshSeconds }` — an extensible bag; the line-width fields join
  the wire at protocol v61 and `terminalWindowsShell` at v62. **`DEFAULT_MODEL_PROTOCOL_VERSION`** pins
  v72's AppConfig `defaultModel`/`defaultEffort` and host-side default resolution; the Settings controls are
  hidden against older hosts. `defaultModel` is a full allowlisted `WireModel`, `defaultEffort` is an optional
  `ThinkingLevel`, and `settings.update` accepts `null` to clear either optional value.
  **`MODEL_PICKER_PROTOCOL_VERSION`** (v77) pins the picker's host-kept lists: **`favoriteModels`** (full
  `WireModel`s in the user's display order — the client writes the whole list through `settings.update`,
  identity by `sameModel`) and **`recentModels`** (newest-first, at most **`RECENT_MODELS_LIMIT`** = 5,
  **host-maintained**: it is excluded from `AppConfigUpdate`, and the host appends on every explicit model
  choice — a `session.create` that names a model and every `session.setModel`). Both default to `[]`, so a
  client gates only on the version, never on field presence. Snapshots in either list are re-pointed to the
  live catalog by the client before rendering; a model that left the catalog is simply not offered.
  `terminalWindowsShell`
  (`"auto" | "pwsh" | "powershell" | "cmd"`, default `"auto"`) is read only by `server/terminal` on
  Windows and ignored elsewhere — see
  `submodule-server-terminal`'s shell-selection decision for what each value spawns.
  **`PROJECT_TEMPLATE_PREVIEW_PROTOCOL_VERSION`** pins v63's additive project-located `template.list` /
  `template.get` reads, allowing Create Workspace to preview global plus current-checkout project templates
  without sending host paths; older hosts retain a global-only fallback. `themeMode` defaults to `"fixed"`
  and no pair, preserving both legacy configs
  and the explicit Dark default; `subagentsEnabled` is the host-wide subagent default (`true` for current
  behavior), overridden only by `Workspace.subagentsOverride`; `agentReviewEnabled` (default `false`, on the
  wire from `AGENT_REVIEW_SETTING_PROTOCOL_VERSION` = v68) gates the worker's in-session `request_review`
  tool and applies live to open sessions — the Review button is independent (see [[submodule-server-host-plan-review]]); `customLayoutPresets` is the bounded
  resource-free catalog and is the **only** layout value synchronized by the host; current/default preset
  and group limits are web-local); `analyticsEnabled` is the additional-data preference and host gate,
  default `false`, while `analyticsConsentConfirmed` defaults `false` and records completion of the initial
  choice. `ANALYTICS_CONSENT_PROTOCOL_VERSION` pins this v65 contract so newer clients do not show a consent
  flow against older hosts that cannot persist it. The initial dialog first writes the enabled preference
  alone, then completion and the current preference together; Privacy Settings writes both together. An older
  client's preference-only write cannot create the new confirmation. The installation id remains entirely
  server-side; basic events are not controlled by either flag, see [[submodule-server-analytics]]) carries
  it with the **`DEFAULT_CONFIG`** fallback (persisted host-side
  as `config.json`, delivered in
  `server.welcome`, mutated via `settings.update`). Every new user chat receives the resolved model and
  effort explicitly, so the session agrees with `model.default`; explicit request fields win individually,
  while an effort-only request uses the configured or fallback model. Plan-review subagents keep their own model policy.
  **`InterviewResponse`** is the closed `"book" | "postpone" | "never"` action accepted from the automatic
  feedback popup. No usage count, eligibility, dismissal state, or client identity crosses the wire.
  Contracts deliberately exports no theme catalog enum/list/labels: a future manifest can mint an id
  unknown when the host was built, and a client missing it resolves a same-appearance bundled fallback;
  **`SpecGraphNode`/`SpecGraphSnapshot`** — the
  Specs-viewer read DTOs, **mirrored** (like `PiEvent`), never imported from `pi-spec-graph` — the wire
  carries only what the panel renders (`type`/`status` stay `string`: tolerate whatever is on disk);
  **`TodoItem`/`TodoGroupItem`/`TodoPlan`/`TodoArtifact`** + the **`TodoStatus`/`TodoOrigin`/
  `TodoArtifactKind`** unions — the in-chat plan
  DTOs, **mirrored** from `pi-todos/core` (never imported), carrying the chat's per-session TODO list.
  `TodoGroupItem` additionally carries **`status: TodoGroupStatus`** — the group's *task* lifecycle
  (`pending`/`active`/`done`), **derived by the host** from the steps (`pi-todos`' `groupStatus`) rather than
  stored: shipping it means the truth table has one home and no client re-derives it. A `commit`
  artifact additionally carries **`files?: GitFileChange[]`** (path + status + `+/−` — the same rows
  the Changes panel renders at the commit scope) — host-derived from git by `todo.list`'s decoration
  (same one-home rationale), never stored; absent = the sha no longer resolves, degrade silently.
  `TodoItem.summary` / `TodoPlan.summary` are the agent's completion notes (per step / whole plan, as
  stored) and `TodoItem.verification` the separate self-reported check line (exact command + result, or
  "not verified" — clients render it as a badge labeled as the agent's own claim, never a host gate).
  `TodoItem.commitSubject` is the third stored done-time field: the git subject the host commits the
  item's delta under (the `title` is the plan step for the panel, this is the line that lands in the
  repository's history — see [[submodule-server-todos]]). It is on the wire because the DTO mirrors the
  stored item, not because any client renders it today; **`TodoItem.review?: TodoReviewInfo`** (+ the **`TodoReviewState`** union) is the host-derived
  review decoration, present only on reviewable items (those with a host change set): `state`
  (`unreviewed`/`reviewed`/`changes_requested` — `unreviewed` = no stored record), `revision` (commit
  count — 1 TODO = N commits), `unreviewedShas` (commits since the user's watermark — the "changed since
  review" delta), `feedback` + `at`. Review state lives in a host sidecar, never the agent-writable plan;
  see [[submodule-server-todos]]. **`TodoPlan.unattributed?: GitFileChange[]`** is the host-derived
  remainder shipped by the same `todo.list` decoration, present only when non-empty: the worktree's
  uncommitted rows attributed to no item of the plan — the changes that would otherwise be invisible in
  the review map (derivation and rationale: [[submodule-server-todos]]).
  **`TodoPlan.adoptedCommits?: TodoItem[]`** is the committed counterpart, shipped by the same
  decoration and present only when non-empty: the `base..HEAD` commits owned by no item, surfaced as
  **wire-only `done` items** (`origin: "adopted"`, `id: "commit:<sha>"`, one `commit` artifact) so a
  chat that committed without planning still shows — and can review — that work. They are never stored;
  the **`"adopted"`** member of `TodoOrigin` exists only on the wire (derivation: [[submodule-server-todos]]).
  **`DelegationRunDetails`** + the **`DelegationRunStatus`** union — the subagent Agent-card DTO,
  **mirrored** from `pi-delegation` (never imported): rides `tool_execution_update.partialResult`
  (REPLACE), the final `Agent` tool result, and the `subagent-completion` custom message; the
  child transcript itself is read via `subagent.getTranscript`, keyed
  `(workspaceId, parentSessionId, childSessionId)` — its result also carries the run's current
  registry `status` (absent once the host no longer knows the run), the client's poll-while-live
  signal. The completion message's tag + pairing live in
  `wsProtocol` (the value-bearing half), mirroring the ask-user-answers posture exactly: the
  **`SUBAGENT_COMPLETION_CUSTOM_TYPE`** constant (mirrors `pi-subagents`' `SUBAGENT_COMPLETION_MESSAGE`,
  never imported — the DTO posture again), **`SubagentCompletionMessage`** (the compile-held tag↔details
  shape) and the shared **`isSubagentCompletionMessage`** guard — wire data is untrusted, so the
  details validate through **`isDelegationRunDetails`** (domain): the **closed status union**, every
  required **numeric usage field**, `durationMs`, and every present optional display field as a string,
  never just "an object is present" (PR #303 review finding). That validator is the one home for the
  shape check — the web's Agent-card reader
  narrows through it too — plus **`customMessageText`** — the one text extraction over
  `WireCustomMessage.content` (string | blocks), shared by the web's event reducer and hydration so the
  completion card's text derives once.
  **history-search read DTOs** — **`HistoryScope`** (the overlay's cycle: this chat → workspace →
  project → everywhere); **`PromptHit`** (a recalled prompt; carries optional `messageIndex` +
  `anchorText` — the kept-newest occurrence's jump anchor) and **`MessageHit`** (a full-text
  conversation match; assistant-only — a user-role hit only ever duplicates its own `PromptHit`'s text,
  so the jump affordance lives there instead; `messageIndex` anchors jump-to-message into
  `session.getMessages` order, `anchorText` makes the anchor drift-tolerant), and
  **`HistorySearchResult`** (the prompts + full-text messages sections, with totals and indexing status);
  the **review DTOs** — **`Review`** (one open review per workspace; `baseSha` — the reviewed diff's
  ORIGINAL side (the branch range's fork point, what that diff actually displays — never the target's
  tip, which can carry upstream commits the review never showed) pinned to a **full commit oid at
  creation**, immutable for the review's life — plus **`fileSessions`**, key → that
  key's review chat: one chat per file, pinned on first send, the **empty key** being the anchorless
  whole-change-set bucket, pinned the same way so a second overall remark continues one discussion —
  and **`doneFiles`**, same keys: files whose review the user marked finished, so a fully-resolved
  file leaves the list only on their say-so), **`ReviewComment`** (`kind`
  inline/diff/file/review; `status` draft/sent/resolved/
  dismissed — orthogonal to **`anchorState`** anchored/moved/outdated; per-comment `sessionId` — the
  chat it was sent into), **`ReviewAnchor`** (`path` + `side` + `contentHash` + an ordered **`ReviewSelector`**
  fallback chain: `lineRange` / `textQuote` / `diffHunk` / `structural` / `region` — `structural` is the
  typed-by-scheme slot for document models with stable identities (`json-pointer`, `ipynb-cell`,
  `table-cell`, `md-heading`, plus whatever scheme a renderer mints: unknown schemes cross the wire
  verbatim, only the shape is checked) and `region` is normalized `0..1` geometry with an optional
  1-based `page` for paged media, so a comment can name an image region or a notebook cell instead of a
  line; Ask-agent hunk comments populate `diffHunk` with the exact displayed hunk header, and `contentHash` is sha-256 over the
  resource's BYTES (byte-identical to the former text hash for valid UTF-8).
  **`REVIEW_RICH_ANCHORS_PROTOCOL_VERSION`** pins the additive `region` member and the now-populated
  `structural` slot to v74, so a renderer-rich client tells a host that preserves them from one that
  predates them instead of having a region anchor silently dropped; a `side: "base"` anchor additionally carries **`baseRef`**, the ref
  its lines and fragment were captured against, since the two diff sides are two line spaces, plus the
  **`scope`** it was captured in — the diff identity that reopens the one surface rendering that blob),
  **`ReviewSnapshot`** (`{ review, comments }` — the `review.get`
  read and, with `workspaceId`, the `review.changed` push payload **`ReviewChangedPayload`** —
  full-snapshot so replay is idempotent);
  **prompt-template DTOs** — **`TemplateScope`** (`"global"` | `"project"` — where a template lives),
  **`TemplateInfo`** (metadata only: name, optional `description`/`argumentHint`, `scope`, `filePath` —
  what `template.list` returns; deliberately body-free so a listing never ships every file's full text),
  and **`Template`** (`TemplateInfo` + full `content` — frontmatter + body — the by-name
  `template.get`/`template.save` shape);
  **layout preset DTO** — portable **`LayoutPreset`**, the bounded resource-free frame grammar synchronized
  in `AppConfig.customLayoutPresets`: center topology, left/right/bottom group geometry, visibility/folds,
  bottom alignment, and singleton tools, but no workspace, file, diff, chat, document, terminal, preview,
  attention, or current/default-selection identity. Every current-layout type—including the projected
  `WorkspaceLayoutDocument`, `WorkbenchFrame`, and `WorkspaceViewState`—is web-local and deliberately absent
  from contracts. There is no current-layout method or push channel.
- **nativeClient.ts** — type-only optional native-client capabilities outside the host wire. The desktop
  update bridge exposes a monotonic state snapshot, prompt check/download/install actions, failed-operation
  identity, and state subscription without exposing feed selection. Available, byte-transfer, preparation,
  ready, and installing are distinct states. The window-controls bridge exposes the same
  snapshot/action/subscription shape for window state; a browser connection has neither bridge and renders
  neither affordance.
- **`HostUpdateNotice`** — the optional host-wire CLI lifecycle: current version, newer available version,
  channel, and an optional closed `available | running | succeeded | failed` status (absent means the legacy
  v64 advisory). `host.updateAvailable` publishes full replacements. Protocol v70 adds parameterless
  `host.update`; no output, arbitrary diagnostic, feed URL, artifact, platform path, or shell command crosses
  the wire.
- **wsProtocol.ts** — `WS_METHODS` (`project.*` — incl. **`project.close`** (mark the stable record
  closed without deleting associated state), **`project.inspect`** (classify a path) + **`project.init`**
  (`git init` + commit, then open) + **`project.hasSpecs`** (lazy per-project "contains a registered
  spec?" for the Welcome screen — a full-tree walk, so requested only for the shown project,
  never eagerly for every project) / `workspace.*` — notably **`workspace.list { projectId,
  includeDiffStats? }`**, where omitted/true preserves the existing full rows with computed aggregates and
  `false` returns the same authoritative membership/order without the synchronous per-workspace diff-stat
  fan-out used nowhere by navigation restoration / `fs.*` (**`fs.readFile`** answers
  `{ content, meta: ResourceMeta }`) / `git.*` / **`spec.graph`**
  (the Specs-viewer whole-graph read, per workspace) / **`todo.*`** — **`list`**/**`add`**/**`update`**/
  **`remove`**, the chat's per-session TODO plan (keyed by `workspaceId` + `sessionId`; `add` tags the
  item `origin:"user"`), plus the review ops **`review`** (approve: record `reviewed` + the sha
  watermark), **`requestFix`** (record `changes_requested` + feedback, then the host fires the fix
  package into the item's own chat — detached, rolled back on a pre-turn rejection) and
  **`startReview`** / **`reviewAll`** (the AGENT review: a hidden review subagent gets the item's
  package and returns a structured verdict; findings arrive as `author: "agent"` review comments;
  `TodoItem.review` carries `reviewing` while the verdict is pending and `reviewedBy` on an agent
  approve. `reviewAll` reports the count it started, and `alreadyRunning` when the plan's serial chain
  is still busy) / **`terminal.*`** — **`reserve`** (idempotently establishes a host-catalog tab
  without starting its PTY; `INITIAL_TERMINAL_TAB_KEY` names the one host-seeded tab that every frontend
  may place passively) / **`attach`** (idempotent get-or-create keyed by `(workspaceId, tabKey)`,
  returning `created` + the `replay` to repaint; the only way a PTY is born, and it replaced
  `create`+`alive`) / **`list`** (the host owns the tab list) / `write` / `resize` /
  **`close`** (by `tabKey`, refusing a busy shell unless `force`) / `model.list` + **`model.refresh`** (awaits the host's
  single-flighted catalog refresh and returns **`RefreshedModels`** — the post-refresh list plus
  **`complete`**, whether that pass settled inside the host's capped wait, since only a settled list is
  authoritative; `force` bypasses pi's 4h freshness throttle, so a user-initiated refresh actually fetches) /
  **`model.default`** (the host-resolved model and compatible effort: AppConfig's default model when
  available, otherwise the first model in the host's settled available list, otherwise `null`; effort is
  `defaultEffort ?? "medium"`, clamped with Pi's `clampThinkingLevel` when a model exists) /
  **`model.contextSettings`** / **`model.setContextWindow`** (v76; both return
  **`ModelContextSetting[]`** — the eligible OpenAI models' `provider`/`id`/`name`, pi's effective
  `contextWindow`, and the explicit models.json `override` or `null` for pi's default. The mutation takes
  `{target: "available" | {provider,id}, contextWindow: number | null}`: `null` removes the override;
  a number must satisfy **`isModelContextWindow`** within **`MODEL_CONTEXT_WINDOW_LIMITS`**
  (272,000–1,000,000), the app's editing policy rather than a verified provider capacity, enforced on
  both sides. External values outside it are read without clamping, and the `available` target covers
  only settings **`isSharedModelContextTarget`** accepts (no override, or one inside the range): an
  override the app could not have written is changed only by naming its `{provider,id}`. Saves emit the
  existing `provider.changed` invalidation; no AppConfig state or raw configuration crosses the wire) /
  **`model.clampThinking`** (pi's
  `clampThinkingLevel` for a `{model, level}` pair — the pre-session picker's effort adjustment, so no
  client re-derives pi's policy) / **`provider.status`**
(the auth-provider status report; every read revalidates host-side) / the **`provider.*` in-app login**
  (**`loginStart`** — mints a `loginId` and runs pi's login flow **detached** (`type` `"oauth"` |
  `"api_key"`, issue #97 — both auth routes ride one channel; a flow can take minutes and must
  not sit on the request nor block the WS pump) / **`loginReply`** — answers a live `select`/`prompt`,
  correlated by `loginId` / **`loginCancel`** / **`logout`** /
  the **JetBrains AI** set **`jbcentralConnect`** / **`jbcentralDisconnect`** /
  **`jbcentralStartProxy`** / **`jbcentralUpdate`** / **`jbcentralLogin`** (native global Central actions
  returning `JbcentralActionResult`; none accepts an executable, artifact path, output, URL, or secret from
  the client) / **`jbcentralQuota`** (v59; optional `force` bypasses completed-cache age but still joins an
  in-flight read; disabled/unhealthy returns `hidden` without invoking quota)) /
  **`workspace.listExisting`** (the selected project's unattached Git worktrees, with detached rows
  disabled by status) / **`workspace.openExisting`** (revalidate + register one branch-backed checkout as
  `kind: "external"`, emitting the ordinary `workspace.created`, without mutating Git or disk) /
  **`workspace.rename`** (`{ id, name }` → the locked updated `Workspace`; managed worktrees only;
  changes the display name while preserving the Git branch + cwd, and broadcasts the ordinary full-snapshot
  `workspace.updated`; `WORKSPACE_RENAME_PROTOCOL_VERSION` pins its v55 introduction so a newer client with
  this action omits it against an older host) / **`workspace.openReview`** (the active
  branch's optional `OpenBranchReview` metadata; optional `allowCached: true` permits a settled host
  cache hit while omission preserves the original force-fresh behavior for older independently shipped
  clients; either form still joins a lookup already in flight) /
  **`project.setTrust`** (persist a project's trust grant → the updated `Project`; gates its committed
  cross-agent skill aliases) /
  **`skill.list`** (a pre-session, skill-only `SlashCommandInfo[]` preview for a `projectId`, resolved from
  that project's current checkout with its **project-scoped aliases gated by trust**; the eventual worktree
  session is authoritative) / the **Skills-manager set** — **`project.aliasSkills`** (present committed alias
  names, for the presence-gated notice's count) / **`project.acknowledgeSkills`** (confirm skills that
  appeared after trust) / **`project.setSkillEnabled`** (project baseline) / **`project.setGroupEnabled`**
  (turn a plugin / source tier / `@plugins` on/off at the baseline) / **`workspace.setSkillOverride`**
  (per-workspace on/off/clear → the `Workspace`) / **`workspace.setSubagentsOverride`**
  (`"on"` / `"off"` / `null`-to-inherit → the updated `Workspace`) / **`workspace.setDiffBase`** (re-point the diff target,
  `null` clears it back to the creation base — echoes the updated `Workspace` **and** broadcasts
  `workspace.updated`, so every client converges on the push) / **`workspace.watchReady`** (await the
  fresh watcher's conservative startup nudge before a skill-loading client captures its freshness baseline;
  `{ startupNudge }` is true unless the watcher was already known ready, so a replayed response can supply
  the client's conservative fallback when the event push was lost or startup failed; an optional
  `prewarm: true` marks the started watcher as prewarm-only — the host keeps those in a globally bounded,
  evictable pool and any real preflight/read promotes them out of it, see the server `watch` SPEC) / **`git.status`** +
  **`git.diffFile`** (whose two sides ride with `ResourceMeta` and whose `originalOid` freezes the range's
  original side for `/blob`), both
  taking an optional **`scope: GitDiffScope`** (an unresolvable scope — a commit a rebase removed — is
  *rejected*, which the panel reads as "reset the scope" instead of staying wedged on a dead sha) /
  **`git.listCommits`** (the workspace branch's own commits, `<diff base>..HEAD`, newest first, capped
  host-side — the scope menu's lazily-fetched list) / the **`change.*` write path**
  (`CHANGE_MUTATIONS_PROTOCOL_VERSION` = v75) — **`change.revert`** (`{ workspaceId, path, scope,
  target, expect: { originalHash, modifiedHash } }` → `{ receipt }`: the client names *what it saw*, the
  host re-derives the change from its own reads under a per-workspace lock, and either side's hash
  mismatching is `STALE_VIEW` with nothing written — the agent keeps working during review, so
  compare-and-swap is the whole protection; symlink and mode-only inputs are `UNSUPPORTED_CHANGE`) and **`change.undo`** (`{ workspaceId, receiptId, expect:
  { modifiedHash } }` → `{ receipt }`: receipts are the inverse, which is why the UI offers *Undo*
  instead of a confirmation on every hunk; the `undo` receipt it answers with is itself undoable once, so
  redo needs no third method). Receipts live in host memory only (per workspace: at most 20, at most
  64 MiB of held bytes, oldest evicted first, the newest always kept; dropped with the workspace): git
  and the OS trash already back recovery, so a data-dir format would buy nothing — hence
  `RECEIPT_UNKNOWN` rather than a wire promise of durability / **`git.prefetch`** (best-effort background fetch of a
  remote base — the New-Workspace dialog's freshness warm-up; always acks `{ ok }`, and when the fetch
  actually moved the local remote-tracking ref the host follows up with pathless `workspace.fsChanged`
  frames to the workspaces whose diff base that ref is, so their git-derived reads re-converge) / **`skills.state`** (`SkillCatalogEntry[]` — full catalog +
  per-skill `decision` + `group` — for a `workspaceId`) / **`project.skills`** (the same, project-scoped, for
  the pre-session manager) / **`session.reloadResources`** (re-scan skills + rebuild the system prompt for one
  running session; rejected while streaming) /
  `session.*` — `create`/`prompt`/`steer`/`followUp`/**`clearQueue`** (drain Pi's steering+followUp
  queues, returning complete `SessionQueueContent`; Pi itself emits the emptying `queue_update`; optional
  `requireTextOnly` rejects without draining when the host has observed queued images, which is the manual
  compaction precondition)/**`removeQueued`** (`{ kind, index }` → `RemovedQueuedMessage`: drop or extract ONE
  queued message with its complete content — the strip rows' edit/remove; position-addressed because Pi's
  queue entries are bare strings with no id, and the host emulates per-item removal over Pi's all-or-nothing
  `clearQueue`, see the server agent SPEC)/**`abort`** (ordinary abort preserves queued lanes for Interrupt;
  `{ restoreQueue: true }` atomically drains complete content before signalling abort and returns it after the
  session reaches idle, which is Stop's lossless path)/`dispose`/**`delete`**/`setModel`/
  `setThinkingLevel`/`compact`/`getStats`/`getCommands`/`extUiReply`/**`answerQuestion`** (the inline
  `ask_user_question` reply, correlated by tool call id)/**`list`**/**`getMessages`** (the
  read side) / **`settings.update`** (merge + validate + persist a top-level partial `AppConfig`; when present,
  `customLayoutPresets` and `systemThemePair` are complete replacements; entering system mode requires a
  complete existing-or-incoming pair. A legacy `{ theme }` mutation without explicit `themeMode` means a
  fixed-theme selection and exits system mode; returns the merged config) /
  **`feedback.respond`** (`{ action: InterviewResponse }` → ack; persists the automatic invitation's book,
  postpone, or permanent-dismiss result; the Settings link never calls it;
  `FEEDBACK_INTERVIEW_PROTOCOL_VERSION` pins the addressed channel's v56 introduction so the host does not
  claim an independently shipped older client that omits the current `?protocol=` socket capability) / **`history.search`** (the prompt-recall + conversation-search read; results capped,
  recency-ordered; the messages section is assistant-only — a user-role hit surfaces as a jumpable
  `PromptHit` instead, never a separate `MessageHit`) / the **`review.*` set** — **`get`** (the open
  review + comments, lazily created; re-anchored on read) / **`commentAdd`**/**`commentUpdate`**/
  **`commentDelete`** (authoring + manual resolve/dismiss; delete is DRAFT-only — a sent comment is a
  record, and resolved is final: no reopen and no
  worktree rollback on the wire; `commentAdd` takes the diff tab's
  `scope`, which is what lets the host resolve a base-side anchor's `baseRef` — and is persisted on the
  anchor) / **`sendComment`** (one comment → its FILE's review chat, created on the file's first send
  then `followUp`ed) / **`sendBatch`** (all/selected drafts, grouped per key into each key's chat;
  answers with **every** session it touched, in group order — naming only the first left the other
  chats invisible while their comments already read as sent) — both carry **`ReviewSendResult`**: `session.create`'s shape
  plus **`reused`**, the one fact only the host knows (was this chat followed up into, or created now?).
  A reused chat may be one the client has never seen — a second client, or this one after a reload,
  since review state and pi transcripts both outlive the host — so it must be HYDRATED, not opened as
  new; opening it as new shows a blank conversation for comments already marked sent / **`fileDone`**
  (mark a fully-resolved file's review finished; rejected while anything is unresolved — a new
  comment re-opens the file) / **`close`** (the atomic Clear: archive the current review's non-draft
  records, discard drafts, replace the active review, and publish the fresh open snapshot to every client)
  — plus
  **`template.*`** — prompt-template CRUD
  (**`template.list`**, **`template.get`** — reads accept one optional location, `workspaceId` or
  `projectId`, and reject both; no location is global-only, while either located form merges project over
  global; **`template.save`**, **`template.delete`**) — all
  read/write pi's prompt dirs (global + project), so templates stay CLI-portable,
  `WS_CHANNELS` (`server.welcome` — which carries the initial `config: AppConfig` alongside **`projects`**
  (open records) and **`recentProjects`** (all known records, open + closed), plus optional
  **`hostUpdate: HostUpdateNotice`** and **`hostPlatform`**
  (`darwin | linux | win32`, optional for older hosts) — the OS the *host* runs on, so a client that
  offers host-executed commands (the PR setup dialog) picks the right ones instead of guessing from
  the browser / **`host.updateAvailable`** — the backward-compatible full CLI-update snapshot: initially
  published when a launcher finds a newer release, then replaced as a v70 host-run moves through
  running/succeeded/failed; absent on discovery failure/no-update / **`project.updated`** — the
  full persisted `Project` snapshot after open/reopen/close, including `closed` membership, so every client
  atomically converges its rail + Recents without optimistic removal / `pi.event` / `pi.extensionUi` /
  **`session.created`** (the initial `SessionSummary`, broadcast when a new host-owned session registers so
  other frontends can list it in history without opening local placement) / **`session.deleted`** (workspace +
  session id; a non-replayable domain event broadcast after permanent deletion so every client removes the chat
  and blocks stale hydration) / **`settings.changed`** (the full `AppConfig`, including custom preset definitions, broadcast so every
  client converges) / **`feedback.interview`** (an empty, addressed invitation sent only to the host-claimed
  frontend; not broadcast, subscribed, or replayed) / **`provider.login`** — the session-less
  in-app login stream (a `LoginPush`
  per frame, keyed by `loginId`; the sibling of `pi.extensionUi`, since a login runs on the Welcome screen
  before any session exists) / **`provider.changed`** — a data-free invalidation broadcast after a watched
  Central state/rebuild result changes the host-authoritative provider status or current model generation;
  clients re-read `provider.status` and invalidate `model.list`, so no raw provider/model data rides the push /
  `terminal.data` + **`terminal.exit`** + **`terminal.detached`** (the addressed terminal channels — sent to
  the single *attached* client rather than broadcast, so a shell's bytes never
  reach another browser; `terminal.data` may carry `truncated` when the host had to drop held output,
  `terminal.detached` says another client took the tab over) / the **workspace lifecycle
  trio** — **`workspace.created`**
  / **`workspace.updated`** / **`workspace.removed`** — registry membership changes fanned out to every
  client so it stays shared domain state (architecture #9), all emitted by the server's `workspaces`
  publisher (never a per-client optimistic mutation). `created`/`updated` carry the **full persisted
  `Workspace` snapshot** (idempotent under the transport's last-value replay, so e.g. an agent rename
  racing a manual one merges by `id` — never a delta); `removed` carries a **`WorkspaceRemoved`** id
  pair (`{ projectId, id }` — the record is already gone) / **`review.changed`** — a workspace's review
  state changed (emitted by the server's `reviews` publisher on every mutation — UI edits, agent
  `resolve_comment` calls, re-anchoring — so all clients converge, same pattern as the trio) /
  **`workspace.fsChanged`** — the worktree
  change-notifier push (**`WorkspaceFsChangedPayload`**: `{ workspaceId, paths, truncated, skillChange }`,
  worktree-relative deduped paths, capped — `truncated` means the generic path list is incomplete and must
  be treated as a wildcard; `skillChange: "none" | "detected" | "unknown"` is an **independent semantic
  fact**, accumulated before that cap, so a concrete non-skill overflow stays `none`, a skill path omitted
  after the cap stays `detected`, and only a pathless platform/startup uncertainty is `unknown`; a pathless
  non-truncated/`none` frame is a whole-workspace invalidation such as repo-metadata drift); an
  **invalidation nudge, not data**: clients re-read via the existing read methods, so a duplicate/replayed
  frame is harmless.
  The `WsMethodMap` typed request/result map +
  `WsParams`/`WsResult` helpers, and `PROTOCOL_VERSION`. Request ids are also the reconnect idempotency key:
  an unresolved client replays the same frame/id, and the host returns the one cached result for
  `(clientKey, requestId)` instead of executing the handler again. Two client→host frames that are *not* requests close
  that loop (hence **`WsClientMessage`**, discriminated on the key): **`WsAck`** (`{ ack: string[] }`) names
  responses the client has *read* — the only thing that distinguishes a reply the page received from one that
  died in a socket buffer, and so the only thing that lets the host free a retained result — and **`WsResume`**
  (`{ resume: string[] }`), sent on every (re)connect ahead of the replays, names the complete set the page
  still considers unresolved, so the host can release everything else. `resume` exists because a receipt is only
  as reliable as the socket carrying it and nothing would ever re-send a lost one: restating the live set beats
  confirming the confirmations. This behavior is protocol-versioned — a replaying UI must never run against a
  pre-dedup host.

## Chat Resources

The current-chat resource view is a projection of two existing capability owners, not a generic
process API. `CHAT_RESOURCES_PROTOCOL_VERSION` (71) gates its methods and affordances; hosts through
v70 must not receive these requests. No native Pi background-task protocol is implied. The command DTOs mirror [[module-pi-background-commands]]
without importing that package. Subagents retain their Pi child session ids and delegation statuses.

- `session.resources({workspaceId, sessionId})` returns separate command and subagent summaries:
  all currently active records plus bounded recent terminal records. The snapshot echoes workspace
  and session identity. Commands mirror the owner's bounded snapshot; subagent summaries carry only
  child/parent ids, role, task, status, creation time and optional abort reason, not usage or reports.
  Subagent role/task summaries are capped at 200/2,000 characters, with the latest twenty terminal
  children by creation order retained in the projection. These are runtime catalogs; neither historical
  tool acknowledgements nor persisted PIDs supply live authority after restart.
- `backgroundCommand.output({workspaceId, sessionId, commandId})` returns the current bounded
  `{available: true, command, output: {text, truncated}}`, or `{available: false}` for an unknown,
  foreign or evicted command after validating its parent. Output REPLACES the previous snapshot;
  truncation is explicit. It accepts no filesystem path or PID.
- `backgroundCommand.stop({workspaceId, sessionId, commandId})` and
  `subagent.stop({workspaceId, parentSessionId, childSessionId})` request cancellation of one owned
  resource. Known terminal resources are idempotent successes; unknown, expired or foreign ids
  share the `RESOURCE_UNAVAILABLE` error code. Unavailable parent sessions use that same code.
  A successful `Ack` acknowledges intent, not observed termination.
- `subagent.stopAll({workspaceId, parentSessionId})` captures the currently active direct children,
  requests every cancellation before returning `Ack & {targeted: number}`, and never waits for child
  settlement. The individual subagent stop follows the same intent-only acknowledgement rule. Neither
  operation stops the parent, removes child records, or disables future launches; lifecycle invalidations
  report eventual settlement.
- `session.resourcesChanged` is a scoped `{workspaceId, sessionId}` invalidation on membership or
  lifecycle changes. Clients reread the snapshot; output bytes do not ride a broadcast or transcript
  tool update after the start acknowledgement. Existing `subagent.getTranscript` remains unchanged.

`DelegationRunDetails.abortReason` mirrors the optional string owned by [[module-pi-delegation]].
Historical details without this field stay valid; non-string values are rejected by its guard. User
Stop uses `"user"` so the portable completion owner can suppress idle-parent wake-up without a
wire-owned cancellation registry.

`background-command-completion` is a displayed Pi custom message, not a catalog update. Its guarded
wire details contain terminal snapshot metadata without the full command, plus the owner's bounded
plain-text diagnostic excerpt and truncation flag. The conversation may render that historical notice,
but must never infer current resource authority from it; logs and controls still use scoped reads.

Every read/control validates workspace membership and parent lineage, not merely a syntactically
valid id. Parent and child session ids use Pi's canonical grammar, including internal dots; workspace,
command, and transcript authority still comes from their owning registries rather than the spelling of
an opaque id. The start capability stays agent-facing; there is no browser shell-execution method.
Reconnection invalidates old control authority until hydration completes; transient read failure
must not become a successful empty snapshot. Unsupported hosts clear earlier resource projections.
Recent command output is ephemeral; completed-message excerpts and child transcripts have their
own existing Pi transcript persistence, not a second wire-owned history store.

## Normalized session state

`SessionState` carries orthogonal host facts: `execution` (`idle | running`) plus stable `runId`, nullable
`needsInput` (stable `interactionId`, `question | dialog`; a pending dialog also carries its exact replayable
request), nullable latest `completion` (stable id and explicit
`succeeded | failed(error|length) | interrupted | cancelled` outcome), Pi's queue count, and the
owner-global `completionUnread` receipt projection. `SessionStateRecord` adds session/workspace/project
attribution; `SessionSummary.state` carries the exact attached session's state.

`session.stateList` is an authoritative all-workspace snapshot of every top-level live or disk session and
fails rather than returning an incomplete scan. `session.state` pushes a full record after the causative Pi
event. `session.acknowledgeCompletion` compare-and-sets one exact completion id; needs-input is never
acknowledgeable. `session.nudge` atomically no-ops for needs-input, queues during running work, and prompts
an idle session. These coordinated methods start at `SESSION_STATE_PROTOCOL_VERSION`; older hosts simply
provide no cross-workspace state.

The request registry also keeps `session.activityList` returning literal `[]` for one compatibility window,
so an already-loaded old client clears retired markers after reconnect. No activity push or type returns.

## Get right

- **Mirrors are not version-pinned in comments.** A shape re-declared here because its real home is
  Node-only carries *what* it mirrors, never *which pi version it was last checked against*: those
  markers had to be hand-edited across several files on every bump and nothing verified them. A
  UI-relevant lifecycle member must be explicit here (especially the host-enriched `agent_settled`);
  UI-irrelevant session events such as `entry_appended` may remain unmodelled and ignored. Re-audit a
  mirror when a bump's changelog touches it, not because a comment names a version.
- **Type-only, from the package roots, always** (type-only imports are erased by
  `verbatimModuleSyntax`, so the web bundle stays provider-free; the pi-ai provider/API subpaths
  statically import the Node SDKs — never touch them). The `/base` entries existed only in 0.79.8–0.79.9.
- `Model` is generic — expose as `Model<any>`.
- `AssistantMessageEvent` (the streaming deltas) is nested under `message_update.assistantMessageEvent`,
  never a top-level event `type`.
- Internal relative imports are **extensionless** (`./domain`), not `./domain.ts` — `composite` emits
  declarations, which is incompatible with `allowImportingTsExtensions`.
- **Bundle gate:** `bun build` the web app and confirm **no** `@anthropic-ai/sdk` /
  `openai` / `node:fs` appears.

## Consumed by

`web` (types + WS constants) and `server` (same, + mapping `session.*` to `AgentSession` methods). The
shell panels need `domain` + `wsProtocol`; the `pi` types + `PiEvent` are the wire for the agent session.
