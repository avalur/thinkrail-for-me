## Responsibility

`pi-delegation` is the **portable, pure-pi delegation core**: the session fabric for controlled
children owned by either live parent sessions or independent resources. One creation primitive
(`createChild`) with orthogonal axes; a handle that owns the run loop (per-parent FIFO pacing, turn
caps, usage aggregation); lineage as the storage layout; an in-memory run registry; and lifecycle
events. The contract itself lives on
the barrel (`src/types.ts`, every type documented in place); this SPEC records the semantics, the
boundary, and the decision log.

The session-parent path supports hidden, non-interactive children with explicit `SessionOptions`,
consumed by [[module-pi-subagents]]. The approved resource extension adds a resource owner and
`fork-captured` history alongside fresh origins, using the same assembly and run owner. Other
predeclared combinations remain **loud-rejected** with typed `DelegationError`s (scope & readiness
rules below).

## Approved resource-owned extension

The durable DAG consumer [[module-pi-dag]] adds an independent resource owner alongside session
parents. No dummy parent session or live-parent lookup is required for resource children. This revises
the parent-only workflow assumption and decision #9 below for this additional ownership path; existing
parent APIs, defaults, collection, events and cascades retain their semantics. This extension is
implemented; parent-only descriptions below continue to document the session-parent path.

The service exposes `registerResource` and provider-independent `captureHistory`. Resource handles own
prepared execution context, local concurrency and curated factories; they expose `validateModels`,
`createChild`, `reopenChild` and `release`. Child handles expose identity/record, `runQueued`, literal
active-only `steer`, `abort` and `dispose`, not raw sessions or a second run loop. `resolveParent` is
optional for resource-only construction. Release settles pending assembly/children/extensions and
never disposes an externally borrowed runtime or unrelated parent-owned children.

Capture accepts a trusted read-only pi manager with explicit entry/before-tool-batch cut, or a settled
stored resource child with its saved boundary. It returns canonical branch JSONL plus identity,
boundary, digest and size. The consumer retains bytes; core validates/captures/forks without a second
history store. `fork-captured` adds immutable input while existing live-source fork/seeded placeholders
remain rejected. Empty cuts are explicit, tool-incomplete/corrupt captures fail, compaction and labels
are preserved, and source history is never mutated. Resource transcript lookup is strict and shared
by capture/reopen, not an arbitrary file importer.

`reopenChild` consumes the saved immutable birth record excluding its path, plus saved declarative
session configuration. It validates owner/scope/file identity and preserves birth metadata, resolving
only a new access path. Missing files never create replacement sessions. A crash-dangling final tool
batch receives generic error results before pi replay; a non-tail or malformed gap fails closed because
no positional repair is safe. Fork assembly persists the actual model and pi-clamped thinking in the
child branch; source metadata/global defaults stay intact.
Pi reloads opted-in resources on reopen; saved configuration is not a frozen rendered prompt.

`RunOutcome` gains invocation-local `stopReason` and terminal `historyEntryId`. Finalized-message
observation survives compaction; usage remains pi-stat deltas. Resource prompts bypass command and
skill/template expansion. Resource steering synchronously targets only the active invocation through
pi's queue; enqueue is not consumption. Cancellation covers preflight/queued work and cleans residual
queues before admitting another run. All settlement stays inside the existing run owner.

Owners supplying a runtime guarantee its lifetime; registry-based retention reuses opaque provider
replay without reloading source extensions or resynchronizing from later chats. Missing models or
unsupported runtime-only auth paths fail explicitly, not by substitution. Neither kind of retained
object is a credential snapshot or an ownership lease. Regression coverage must include later child
creation after source-chat disposal, unchanged parent behavior, and zero-worker retention.

### Resource implementation decisions and verification

- Resource transcripts use `<delegationRoot>/<scope>/.resources/<resourceId>/<pi-file>.jsonl`.
  Scope/resource/session segments are validated; capture and reopen share an identity-checked
  locator that rejects ambiguous files, symlinks, non-regular files and malformed v3 history.
  Reopen never uses a caller-supplied path, never manufactures a missing transcript, and treats
  the saved birth record as authoritative for delegation metadata not present in pi's header. It
  repairs only replay-safe missing results at the active tail before constructing the session.
- Registration reserves the identity immediately, prepares context before returning, and does
  not create a session. Duplicate registration fails with `resource-exists`. Effective model
  references must resolve exactly (`model-unavailable`); resource creation never falls back to
  an arbitrary SDK model. Registry inputs replay opaque configured/native provider registrations
  once, without rerunning source extensions. Public auth-source metadata detects runtime-only
  credentials and unavailable stored-auth replay (`unsupported-auth`), without extracting secrets.
  This static check cannot certify opaque provider-private state or future remote authentication.
- Resource concurrency defaults to the service's parent limit (4 unless bound otherwise), with
  independent FIFO slots per resource. Resource-local factories augment the service curated set;
  the existing `session.extensions` opt-in and tool allowlist still apply. Resource handles and
  records never appear in parent lookups, collections, events or disposal cascades. Child specs,
  model refs and nested configuration are detached before admission can await; records and their
  `info` values are frozen copies.
- Release closes all admission synchronously, signals every child before awaiting any teardown,
  settles in-flight assembly, emits/awaits each resource child's `session_shutdown`, disposes
  sessions, then removes registration/context/pacing references. Concurrent release/disposal
  share their existing settlement promises; borrowed runtimes are never disposed.
- Capture serializes one v3 header and exactly the selected ancestor path. `null` is an explicit
  empty branch (`[]`, not `getBranch(null)`). Validation checks identity, shape, ancestry, cuts,
  SHA-256/UTF-8 length, current v3 system/usage/context-edit records and compaction references,
  including retain-none compactions and label entries. Pi's public `buildSessionContext` supplies
  compaction-aware replay; `scanReplayTools` supplies tool closure
  checks and the host repair path's unchanged conservative trailing repair candidates. Failed and
  aborted assistant attempts do not invent missing successful results. Capture never repairs.
  Stored capture reads validated bytes directly and invokes no runtime or mutable SDK file open.
- Forks use an internal private temporary seed with native `SessionManager.forkFrom`, cleaning
  that seed on either result. Before changing prompt, tools or model, the child appends context edits
  that hide Anthropic/Claude signed or redacted thinking: those signatures bind the preceding prefix
  and are not portable to a new child. Canonical captured bytes and raw entries remain unchanged;
  unsigned and other-provider reasoning remains visible. Actual child model and clamped thinking
  changes are appended without changing source history or global settings. Captured strings are
  consumer-retained immutable input, not a core history store. Capture materializes the branch; no
  byte quota is added in this bounded extension. Admission-limit policy remains a follow-up.
- Resource prompt preflight uses literal extension-source input; guarded steering synchronously
  calls public `session.agent.steer` with the unchanged user message. Preflight cancellation is
  checked immediately before pi starts its run, and cancellation is reapplied at agent start.
  Queues are cleared before cancellation and again before settlement/admission of another run.
  `abort()` on a resource handle awaits the invocation's full settlement, including queued work.
- `RunOutcome.stopReason` and final text are the last finalized assistant observation in that
  invocation, retained through retries/compaction; cancellation intent cannot overwrite that
  stop evidence. Usage is still pi cumulative-stat deltas. `historyEntryId` is the settled leaf,
  including metadata/compaction entries, not proof of successful completion.

Regression suites use only local synthetic providers. They cover parent compatibility and captured
parent forks; zero-worker/borrowed/registry/native-provider retention; strict stored capture/reopen
with crash-tail repair and non-tail rejection;
canonical cuts, current v3 entries, digest/closure/compaction validation; source-independent fan-out
with provider-bound thinking sanitization; detached admission inputs; resource-local factories and FIFO
isolation; literal steering and stale-queue cleanup; queued/preflight cancellation; pending assembly/
shutdown release barriers; and finalized outcomes after a shrinking compaction.

## Public surface (the barrel, `index.ts`)

- `createDelegationService(bindings)` — the service (`DelegationService`): `createChild` /
  `findChild` / `childrenOf` / `onLifecycle` / `disposeChildrenOf`, plus `registerResource` /
  `captureHistory`. Resource, birth and captured-history contract types are exported from the
  actual package barrel. `scanReplayTools` is the shared pure replay scanner for capture and host
  transcript repair; repair policy and synthesized tool results remain host-owned.
- `DelegationBindings` — everything host-specific: `resolveParent` (optional for resource-only services; parent creation requires it and a live result; returns
  `ParentContext` — `Pick<ExtensionContext, "cwd" | "model" | "thinkingLevel">` plus optional
  `modelRuntime` and `modelRegistry` fields. The parent's own retained `modelRuntime` is preferred
  over every fallback: an embedder whose sessions each retain their creation-time runtime generation
  (ThinkRail) must give a child its *parent's* generation, or a parent kept alive on a Central-only
  model after a disconnect would delegate into a runtime lacking its provider (PR #303 review
  follow-up). `modelRegistry` is the public pure-pi compatibility path: when neither a parent nor
  service runtime is bound, the core mirrors its opaque extension-provider registrations into the
  self-created runtime before each child is resolved, including removing registrations that have
  disappeared. ThinkRail projects the manager's live session incl. the entry's generation runtime;
  pure pi passes the extension's own `ctx`, including its registry), `delegationRoot`, `scope`,
  `modelRuntime` (a `ModelRuntime` value **or a live provider** `() => ModelRuntime |
  Promise<ModelRuntime>`, resolved **per `createChild`**: an embedder's runtime can be generational
  — ThinkRail swaps runtime generations on Central connect/disconnect — and a value captured at
  service creation would pin every later child to the first generation while new parent chats move
  on (PR #303 review finding); absent → the service self-creates one runtime **per parent lineage**
  and caches it until `disposeChildrenOf(parent)` — a service may resolve parents backed by different
  registries, so one mutable fallback must never synchronize provider state across them),
  `maxConcurrentPerParent`, `childExtensionFactories` (the curated set a child MAY load — decision
  #25).
- Storage helpers: `defaultDelegationRoot` / `delegationSessionDir` / `deriveChildSessionFile`
  (post-restart transcript reads) / `DEFAULT_SCOPE`.
- The contract types themselves (incl. `DelegationError`/`DelegationErrorCode`) — enumerated and
  documented in place in `src/types.ts`, not restated here.

## Boundary

- **Allowed deps:** the pi SDK (`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`, `@earendil-works/pi-ai`) as
  **peerDependencies** — the loading runtime supplies them; `node:*`.
- **Forbidden:** any `@thinkrail/*` package (this package must work under vanilla pi);
  `@earendil-works/pi-tui` (headless by design — rendering is the embedder's);
  importing another workspace package's internals.
- `DelegationRunDetails` is **authored here and mirrored into `@thinkrail/contracts`** (never
  imported from it, never re-exported by it) — the `pi-todos` DTO posture.
- Consumers import **through the barrel only**; `src/` is internal.
- The raw child `AgentSession` never crosses the barrel — `ChildHandle` is the sole control path.

## Patterns = axis combinations

| Pattern | Spec | Driven by |
|---|---|---|
| **Subagent** | `{origin: fresh, visibility: hidden, interactive: false, info: {createdBy: "tool:Agent", roleName, roleSource}, session: from definition}` | `runQueued(task)` — awaited (foreground) or not (background) |
| Interactive subsession | `{origin: fresh \| fork, visibility: listed, interactive: true, info: {createdBy: "user"}}` | the user, via the manager — never a run method |
| Branch | `{origin: fork(current, entryId), visibility: listed, interactive: true, info: {createdBy: "user"}}` (no `session`) | the user |
| Workflow step | `{interactive: false, info: {createdBy: "workflow:<name>"}}` | `runQueued`/`runNow` by an engine |
| Workflow human gate | `{interactive: true, visibility: listed, info: {createdBy: "workflow:<name>"}}` — engine-*created*, human-*driven*: expressible because behavior and provenance are separate fields | the user; engine awaits its conclusion |

## Semantics

### Interactive vs non-interactive (the one behavior split the core enforces)

| | `interactive: false` | `interactive: true` |
|---|---|---|
| Who prompts | the spawner (tool call / engine) | the human (composer) |
| WS prompt input | rejected | accepted (requires `listed`; `hidden + interactive` rejects) |
| Semaphore | `runQueued` waits for a slot; `runNow` bypasses | n/a — the run methods reject |
| `RunOptions.maxTurns` | applies (cap → steer → abort) | n/a |
| Completion | terminal events + `finalText`; delivery (tool result / completion message) is the consumer's | no `finalText` — a "conclude" action when subsessions land |

### Run lifecycle

Every `runQueued` run passes through `queued` — `run-queued` is emitted even when a slot is free
and `running` follows immediately (a uniform event stream is simpler for consumers than a
conditional first state; the diagram's direct `running` entry remains the semantic for `runNow`
when it lands). Entering `queued` initializes matching `RunSnapshot.status` and
`RunSnapshot.details.status`; the transition to `running` updates both fields and the run's
`onUpdate` callback together before `run-started` is emitted, so consumers never observe
contradictory in-flight status surfaces.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> queued: runQueued — semaphore full
    [*] --> running: runQueued (slot free) · runNow
    queued --> running: slot freed

    running --> completed: child final output
    running --> error: child/provider failure
    running --> aborted: caller signal · handle abort · turn-cap steer→abort
    completed --> [*]: awaited outcome · completion message · get_subagent_result
    error --> [*]
    aborted --> [*]
```

### Waiting & control

| Mechanism | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Foreground | `await child.runQueued(task)`. pi executes a batch's tool calls concurrently (verified: `pi-agent-core` `executeToolCallsParallel`), so N `Agent` calls = N children in flight — no `tasks[]`/chain DSL needed. |
| Per-run outcome | A `RunOutcome`'s `finalText`, `stopReason` and `details.usage` belong to **that run alone**: the run captures a session-stat baseline before `prompt()`, observes finalized assistant `message_end` events for text/stop evidence (never a shrinking message-array index), and reports usage/cost/token **deltas** against the baseline — never the child session's cumulative totals. A reusable child running sequential tasks would otherwise return the previous run's text after a preflight failure and double-count usage (PR #302 review finding). `contextTokens` stays a point-in-time snapshot by design. |
| Concurrency | Semaphore **per parent session**, default 4; FIFO. Why: the model decides how many spawns to emit — each child is a full LLM session, so unbounded spawn multiplies token spend, provider 429 pressure, and load on the one shared event loop (no crash isolation). Resource governance, not correctness. Host-wide ceiling: config follow-up. |
| Background | Don't await the promise. Completion → `run-terminal` event; the subagent tool layer additionally injects a `subagent-completion` custom message into the parent. |
| Result collection | Registry snapshot via `findChild(id)`: terminal → final output + details, marks `collected`; running → status snapshot (not an error); unknown id → error naming the restart-loss case + the derived transcript path. |
| Join / wait-all | **Not core.** Engine control flow over `run-terminal` events / run promises: join = `Promise.all` over run outcomes; fan-out = spawns sharing a dependency (the semaphore paces them); fail-fast = one shared `AbortController` across sibling `RunOptions.signal`s. |
| Turn cap | `RunOptions.maxTurns`: on cap, `steer()` a wrap-up instruction, then `abort()`. No wall-clock timeout (provider retries are pi's job). |
| Abort / dispose | `signal` in `RunOptions` (tool abort, engine fail-fast) and `ChildHandle.abort()` both cancel the active run through one run-scoped signal. The handle path must cancel a run that is still **queued**, not merely call `abort()` on its idle pi session: queued cancellation resolves immediately while the eventual slot grant is handed straight back, and no provider work starts (PR #302 review finding, regression-pinned). A running cancellation aborts the pi session. `ChildHandle.dispose()` first marks the child disposed, cancels through that same signal, and awaits the run's terminal settlement before disposing the pi session and removing the child; a queued run therefore cannot hang behind a sibling or emit terminal lifecycle work after `child-disposed` (follow-up PR #302 review finding, regression-pinned). Every child owns one shared teardown promise: concurrent handle disposal and parent disposal both await it, so `disposed` means admission is closed rather than teardown is already complete. Parent dispose → `disposeChildrenOf` cascade, which includes already-disposing children still registered to that parent, then **marks every captured child disposed and signals every active run synchronously before awaiting any shared teardown**; it cannot return while child work is still settling (second follow-up PR #302 review finding, regression-pinned). Aborting a running child frees its semaphore slot, and an unmarked or uncancelled queued sibling could otherwise issue provider work or remain pending during the cascade. A mid-turn parent abort kills only awaited (foreground) runs via their signals; detached runs survive turn aborts. |
| Restart | Foreground dangling toolCalls → healed by the embedder's generic transcript repair (ThinkRail: `repairDanglingToolCalls`). Registry is in-memory: detached runs are lost (accepted); transcripts remain on disk and stay openable. |

A parent id has a replaceable in-memory lifetime. `disposeChildrenOf(parent)` rotates that lifetime
synchronously, detaches its child set, semaphore and fallback runtime, signals every admitted child,
and awaits both those children and child preparations that started in the retired lifetime. A later
parent with the same id receives a fresh lifetime immediately; cleanup from the retired one cannot
remove or admit children into the replacement. A preparation rechecks its captured lifetime after
assembly and disposes the unregistered session before rejecting when stale.

`ChildHandle.abort(reason?)` installs cancellation intent synchronously, including for queued work;
its promise may remain pending while Pi settles an active provider/tool run. Callers that acknowledge
intent rather than settlement may detach that promise, but must attach a rejection handler and continue
to treat lifecycle snapshots as terminal authority.

### Storage & lineage

- **Hidden children persist under the embedder-bound delegation root, never pi's default sessions
  root:** `<delegationRoot>/<scope>/<parentSessionId>/<child>.jsonl` via
  `SessionManager.create(cwd, sessionDir)` — verified: pi accepts a custom `sessionDir` on
  `create`/`open`/`list`/`forkFrom` (the last covers the future `fork` axis). ThinkRail binds
  `~/.thinkrail/delegation` with `scope = workspaceId`; pure pi defaults to
  `<piAgentDir>/delegation` with `scope = "default"`. Hidden by construction: session listings
  scan only the default root.
- **Lineage = the storage layout.** The directory structure *is* the parent edge; the
  transcript path derives from `(scope, parentSessionId, childSessionId)` with no index file. A
  persisted `SpawnRecord` index becomes real when `listed` visibility lands (the type exists now,
  the file does not).
- **The core stores only the parent edge — a tree, never a DAG.** A workflow's steps are all
  spawned with `parent = the run's root session` (siblings); the DAG's data-flow edges are the
  engine's own record. Consequences: whole-run cancel = the existing cascade on the root's
  children (no graph traversal); a join is engine control flow, not a session.
- **Retention is the embedder's:** ThinkRail ties child lifetime to the **workspace** (archival
  deletes; closing a tab deletes nothing — mechanics: [[submodule-server-agent]]). Pure pi: no GC.
  No per-parent GC anywhere.
- `listed` children (future) ride everything that exists — manager registration → tabs, WS
  streaming, hydration, restart repair; the wire's `SessionSummary` grows optional lineage fields
  then, not now.

## Child assembly (what the core owns, consumers never see)

The child's resource loader is **narrow by default**: no discovered extensions, no prompt
templates, no themes; context files, skills, and the embedder's curated extension set
(`extensions: true` — decision #25) are explicit `SessionOptions` opt-ins; `systemPrompt` maps to
`systemPromptOverride`. Model/thinking default to the live parent's current values; `cwd` is the
parent's. Runtime precedence is parent `modelRuntime` → service `modelRuntime` → cached self-created
runtime. The self-created path caches a separate runtime and mirrored-registration set per parent
lineage; `disposeChildrenOf(parent)` drops that cache entry with the lineage. It mirrors the parent's
public `modelRegistry` registrations before each spawn: every previously mirrored id is unregistered
before the current native providers and opaque configured-provider configs are replayed. Rebuilding
rather than merging is required because pi provider re-registration preserves omitted fields; without
the unregister, a same-id replacement can retain stale config such as secret headers. This preserves
extension-supplied provider behavior and config-contained auth without
reading either; it cannot reproduce credentials or mutable state held only inside the original
runtime, which is why exact runtime injection remains the stronger embedder contract. Storage: the
lineage section above.

## Extension points (exactly three, plus one seam)

1. **LLM tools** (the `Agent` tool now) — extension factories over the service. Serves
   LLM-orchestrated workflows with zero further machinery.
2. **The service API** (the barrel) — wire handlers (branch, subsession) and programmatic
   workflows call it directly.
3. **Lifecycle events** — a declarative workflow engine subscribes; every event carries
   `{sessionId, parentSessionId}` so engines build their own step graphs without the core storing
   a DAG.

Plus the **workspace seam** (`WorkspaceProvider`): child isolation (git worktree, tmpdir,
container) as a pluggable strategy. ThinkRail's natural provider already exists — the
projects/workspaces feature owns `git worktree` creation; merge-back semantics live in the
provider's `dispose` (`resultAddendum` tells the parent where work landed), never in the core.
(Pattern validated by gotgenes' ADR-0002 seam + companion worktrees package.)

## Portability & embedding (user-settled, 2026-08)

The layer must **work under vanilla pi** — no ThinkRail. `pi-delegation` itself is a library; the
extension vanilla pi actually loads is its first consumer, [[module-pi-subagents]]. The SDK is a
`peerDependency` (field-verified as the community's in-process pattern — decision #17); peer deps are
exempt from the repo's exact-pin rule, and value-importing the SDK is safe here because the package
lives server-side by construction and never reaches `contracts`/`web` (the wire type is mirrored —
decision #20).

An embedder constructs the service via `createDelegationService(bindings)` and hands it to
consumers — ThinkRail keeps the handle for the manager's dispose cascade and the future wire
handlers, and passes it to the `pi-subagents` factory; under vanilla pi the `pi-subagents`
extension constructs it with defaults. Everything host-specific enters through the one
`DelegationBindings` bag (typed + documented in `src/types.ts`); **every field has a pure-pi
default except the live-parent lookup when session-parent creation is used** — `resolveParent` is
optional for resource-only services; the embedder owns the session-parent lookup (ThinkRail: the manager; pure pi: the consuming extension's own `ctx`).

**Pure-pi bar (user-settled):** the consuming extension loads and runs correctly under vanilla
pi with pi's **default tool rendering** — no pi-tui widget (the rich live card is the web
renderer's job). Verified on demand by `bun run smoke:subagents` (described in
[[module-pi-subagents]]). npm publication stays possible; not a goal.

## Scope & readiness rules (user-settled)

**The implemented core serves subagents and the approved resource-owned extension above.** Other
future patterns are out of scope, their UX unpinned —
but the core must be ready: the **contract carries the full axis space; the implementation stays
minimal**. Unexercised combinations (`listed`, live-source `fork`, `seeded`, `interactive: true`, `runNow`,
`session` absent, a `workspace` provider) **reject loudly** with typed errors — the seam is real,
the dead code is not. A future pattern's first consumer must only *fill in* its combination, never
reshape the contract.

The contract was checked on paper against each future pattern (2026-08, post-implementation):
*subsession* — `{origin: fresh|fork, listed, interactive}` is expressible; run methods on an
interactive child reject (`invalid-combination`). *Branch* — `{origin: fork(entryId), listed,
interactive}` with no `session` options is expressible; pi's `forkFrom` accepts the custom
`sessionDir` (verified). *Workflows* — all three styles map onto the three extension points with
only `runQueued` + `signal` + the dispose cascade. One caveat stands: `WorkspaceProvider`'s call
sequencing (`prepare` names the child id, which exists only after creation) is pinned by its first
consumer, the ThinkRail worktree provider. Report-back from a subsession to its parent (when
subsessions land) is pi-native (`sendMessage`/`followUp`) — no core provision needed beyond
lineage.

## User cancellation

`ChildHandle.abort(reason?: string)` records its optional plain-string reason in the active run's
`DelegationRunDetails.abortReason`, preserved in snapshots, outcomes and terminal events. The first
accepted cancellation wins, including one with no reason; caller signals, disposal and turn caps
participate in that ordering without adding a reason. Terminal runs are unchanged, and each new run
resets both the cancellation latch and reason. Reasons are metadata, not lifecycle statuses.

Child creation revalidates parent liveness after asynchronous session/extension preparation, before
registering the handle. If the embedder closed that parent during preparation, the unregistered child
is disposed and creation fails with `unknown-parent`. This prevents an in-flight birth from escaping
a parent's already-captured teardown list without introducing a second pending-child registry.

The host uses `"user"` for explicit user cancellation; [[module-pi-subagents]] owns its completion
policy. No UI dependency or second registry is involved. Queued cancellation settles immediately,
returns any eventual slot grant and starts no provider work; running cancellation uses the existing
run-scoped signal. Non-user paths retain their behavior.

## Decision log (how the contract got its shape)

1. **Two-phase surface** (`createChild` → `runQueued`/`runNow`) chosen over one mega-`spawnSession`
   and over per-pattern constructors (design-options round): creation and running are different
   moments; the run loop (semaphore, usage aggregation, turn caps) is owned **once** instead of
   per-consumer; most states become valid-by-construction. Per-pattern sugar (e.g. `runSubagent`)
   may appear in consumer layers later — never as the core contract.
2. **`driver: "tool" | "user" | "orchestrator"` enum rejected**: it conflated behavior with
   consumer identity, was a closed set (new consumer = contract reshape), and couldn't express the
   human-gate mix (engine-created, human-driven). Replaced by `interactive` (behavior) +
   `ChildInfo.createdBy` (open provenance).
3. **`SessionOptions` mirrors pi's spawn signature** (user decision) — pi's names/semantics for the
   session-shaping subset; the infrastructure subset (modelRuntime, sessionManager,
   settingsManager, resourceLoader, customTools) is firewalled — exposing it would let a consumer
   bypass storage/lineage/trust.
4. **`maxTurns` in `RunOptions`**, not `SessionOptions` (mirror purity — pi has no such option) and
   not creation (per-run: a chain reuses a child with different caps).
5. **Pacing = two explicit methods** (user round; supersedes a `pacing` option and its brief
   deletion): a `run()` that silently parks on a queue is hidden policy — the call site must say
   which it wants. `runNow` loud-rejects while it has no consumer, consistent with the readiness rule.
6. **`visibility` required, no default** (user round) — same call-site transparency rule. It stays
   a *core* axis because its consequences (storage root, manager registration) are creation-time
   actions only the core may perform, and it is not derivable from `interactive`.
7. **`ChildInfo`** groups descriptive metadata (user round) — the "metadata, never behavior"
   boundary is structural; role label **inlined** as `roleName`/`roleSource` (no nested object for
   two strings; mirrors `DelegationRunDetails`); `roleSource` an open string (the
   builtin/personal/project taxonomy is the subagents layer's vocabulary).
8. **One id, eagerly created**: a run *is* a child session; the child exists from `createChild`
   (queued = only its first prompt waits), so the id is stable for cards/transcripts from birth.
   No separate run UUID.
9. **`parent` is the only identity input** — `scope`/`cwd`/model defaults derive from the
   live parent; inconsistent triples unrepresentable; parent must be live (`unknown-parent`).
10. **Run methods resolve for run failures** (`error`/`aborted` are values with details); typed
    `DelegationError` rejections only for contract misuse.
11. **One run at a time per child**; sequential runs allowed; registry keeps the latest snapshot —
    multi-run history is the caller's bookkeeping. (Revisit if a fleet view ever needs history.)
12. **`background` deleted from the core** — detachment = not awaiting the promise; the registry
    tracks the run either way.
13. **`toolCallId` removed** — run↔toolCall pairing is the tool layer's own bookkeeping.
14. **`SubagentRunDetails` → `DelegationRunDetails`** — the wire type is pattern-generic.
15. **`findChild` / `childrenOf`** (from `getChild`/`listChildren`) — the two lookups key on
    different ids; the name now carries the key.
16. **Raw `AgentSession` never exposed** — the handle is the sole control path; out-of-band
    prompting of a queued child is structurally impossible. (The `resolveParent` binding hands the
    *embedder's* live parent to the core — embedder-side plumbing, not a consumer surface.)
17. **Portable core — the package is the deliverable** (2026-08, PR #261 review round): the user
    settled the requirement that the layer works **without ThinkRail, in pure pi**. Field research
    (source-verified): the pi example spawns `pi --mode json -p --no-session` subprocesses;
    nicobailon spawns subprocesses (foreground + detached runner); **gotgenes and tintinweb run
    children in-process via `createAgentSession` with the pi SDK as a peerDependency** — proving
    in-process pure-pi children are a solved pattern. The core therefore moved from a
    `packages/server` sub-module to `packages/pi-delegation`; ThinkRail is one embedder.
18. **Host-injected spawn seam rejected** (resolves the PR #261 boundary proposal — adopted in
    strengthened form): a `SpawnBackend` the host injects would require a second, in-package
    pure-pi run loop to satisfy #17, duplicating the loop decision #1 deliberately owns once. No
    reference implementation injects a spawner — all four keep spawning inside the extension and
    face their seams *outward* (lifecycle events, providers, RPC). The proposal's boundary half is
    adopted — strengthened: the whole core goes portable, not just the tool layer.
19. **Two packages** — `pi-delegation` (framework) + `pi-subagents` (first consumer): "the
    framework is the deliverable" enforced by construction; future consumers (workflow engine,
    subsession/branch wire handlers) take delegation without subagents. (gotgenes keeps its core
    inside its subagents package; we split because our future consumers are host features — a
    host importing "subagents" to get delegation misnames the dependency.)
20. **`DelegationRunDetails` mirrored into `contracts`, never imported** — the `pi-todos` DTO
    posture keeps `web → contracts`-only intact and the package host-free. (Rejected: authoring
    the type in the package and re-exporting through `contracts` — `contracts` imports no
    extension packages.)
21. **Pure-pi bar: loads + works under default rendering** (user-settled) — no pi-tui widget; the
    rich live card ships web-side.
22. **`collectResult()` added to `ChildHandle`** (implementation round): the `collected` flag needs
    a maintainer, and a side-effectful `snapshot` getter was the only alternative — `snapshot`
    stays a pure read; collection is the explicit act.
23. **`resolveParent` returns a projection, not the `AgentSession`** (user round, subagents
    implementation): pi's extension API exposes only `ExtensionContext` projections — an extension
    can never retrieve its own `AgentSession`, so the raw-session binding was unsatisfiable in pure
    pi. The core reads exactly `cwd`/`model`/`thinkingLevel` (+liveness) off a parent, so
    `ParentContext = Pick<ExtensionContext, …>` (type reuse over new types — user note) covers all
    verified usage in both worlds and structurally prevents the core from driving the parent.
24. **`RunSnapshot.errorMessage`** (review round 2): the terminal snapshot keeps an errored run's
    reason — without it, a detached error collected later via `get_subagent_result` carried zero
    diagnostic (the completion message had it, the collection path didn't).
25. **Child extensions: a curated, embedder-bound set — never inheritance, never disk discovery**
    (user round). `SessionOptions.extensions: true` loads exactly
    `DelegationBindings.childExtensionFactories` (pi's loader loads injected factories even under
    `noExtensions` — verified); the `tools` allowlist gates which of the set's tools are callable;
    children with extensions are bound `mode: "print"` (headless — `ctx.hasUI` false, dialogs
    skipped). Literal "inherit the parent's extensions" is rejected: interactive tools
    (ask_user_question) hang a hidden non-interactive child, and blanket loading multiplies heavy
    extensions per child (gotgenes' documented V8-heap incident class). **Subsessions still ride
    the delegation core** — a subsession IS `createChild({visibility: "listed", interactive: true,
    origin: fresh | fork})`, with the core owning creation, lineage, the registry, and lifecycle
    events exactly as for any child; what the curated-set mechanism does NOT cover is a listed
    child's *resource assembly*: when the listed axis lands, the core acquires an embedder seam so
    a listed child's loader is built by the host's normal session path (ThinkRail:
    `createSession`'s own loader — full bundled set incl. visualize + ask_user_question, skills,
    admission) and the child registers in the host's manager (tab, WS streaming, hydration).
26. **Public provider replay for the pure-pi fallback; exact runtime reuse for embedders.** Pi's
    extension context exposes `modelRegistry` but not its backing `ModelRuntime`, while
    `createAgentSession` requires a runtime. A self-created child runtime therefore synchronizes the
    registry's public `getRegisteredProviderIds` / `getRegisteredNativeProvider` /
    `getRegisteredProviderConfig` values before every spawn and unregisters stale mirrors. The
    runtime and mirror set are keyed by parent lineage and dropped by `disposeChildrenOf`; otherwise
    syncing a second parent could remove or replace a provider still used by the first parent's
    children. This is opaque replay, not provider interpretation, private-field access, or extension
    re-execution. It makes standalone children compatible with provider-registering extensions while
    preserving the stronger parent-runtime path for runtime-only credentials and state.

27. **Resource ownership is not a synthetic session parent.** One prepared resource context and
    local semaphore feed the existing child assembly/run owner; no second session runtime loop,
    child registry API, lineage index or durable payload store is introduced. Parent behavior
    remains independent. This extends decision #9 rather than weakening parent liveness.
28. **Canonical capture is provider-independent and immutable.** A trusted read-only manager or a
    strictly located resource transcript supplies an explicit cut. Replay safety is validated using
    pi context construction and the shared generic scanner. Fork admission validates again; source
    availability after capture is irrelevant. Live-source fork/seeded placeholders remain rejected.
29. **Faithful reopen uses caller birth authority, not invented transcript metadata.** Scope,
    resource/file identity and supported shaping are validated; immutable birth metadata survives
    unchanged except for its newly resolved access path. Opted-in resources reload through normal
    pi assembly, not a persisted rendered prompt.
30. **Resource control is literal and invocation-scoped.** Steering never starts a turn, queues are
    cleared before successor admission, and cancellation spans preflight through terminal settlement.
    Finalized message events supply stop/text evidence; pi persisted-entry stats supply usage deltas.
