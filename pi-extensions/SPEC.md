## Responsibility

The workspace root for pi packages ThinkRail **publishes to npm** and that must work in **vanilla `pi`**
with no ThinkRail present. Each package here is a capability (tools, skills) the agent can use anywhere;
ThinkRail is one embedder among others. The ThinkRail-specific halves of a capability live in
[[module-thinkrail-extensions]], never here.

Until a package's wiring PR lands, its predecessor under `packages/pi-*` stays untouched and loaded by the
host — two copies coexist on purpose and the wiring PR deletes the old one. A new package starts at
`version: 0.0.0` and gets its first real version from its first changeset.

## Identity and distribution

- npm name `@thinkrail.ai/pi-<name>` (the npm org is `thinkrail.ai`, matching the product domain; org name =
  scope), directory `pi-extensions/<name>/`. Only *published* packages use this scope — private workspace
  packages stay `@thinkrail/*`. The scope is deliberate: unscoped `pi-*` names collide (`pi-subagents` is
  third-party) and the scope attributes ownership in the
  `pi.dev/packages` gallery, which is an index of npm packages carrying the `pi-package` keyword — there
  is no registry to submit to.
- **Two shapes.** An *installable pi extension* carries a `pi` manifest (`extensions: ["./index.ts"]`,
  `skills` where present, `image`) and the `pi-package` keyword. A *portable library* (e.g. delegation)
  has named exports only — no manifest, no keyword, never a no-op factory — and is verified through its
  packed consumer.
- **Raw TypeScript, no build step** (pi loads entrypoints through jiti). `files` is a package-specific
  whitelist of everything the entrypoints and `exports` transitively import, tests excluded; `exports`
  preserves every subpath an existing consumer uses (e.g. `./core`). Pi SDK packages are
  `peerDependencies: "*"`; `@earendil-works/pi-tui` is a `"*"` peer where TUI rendering exists. The tested
  pi version is the root catalog's and is never restated here (architecture Decision 10).
- The ThinkRail host consumes these packages through `workspace:*`; the published artifact is verified by
  the parity gate, not by the host.

## Vanilla-parity bar

Required before a package's first publish, and the definition of "works in vanilla pi":

- Installs from its **packed tarball** with dependencies resolved by npm, loads through pi's own
  resolver/loader with zero diagnostics, and registers its tools and skills. (A local-path `pi install`
  installs nothing — it only records the path — so the gate never uses it.)
- **Dual runtime.** Vanilla pi is an npm CLI under Node ≥ 22.19 with jiti; ThinkRail runs the same code
  under Bun. Shipped code uses `node:` builtins and standard ESM only — no `Bun.*`, `bun:*`, or
  Bun-specific `import.meta`.
- TUI: `renderCall` and `renderResult` wherever the plain text fallback reads poorly; every UI call behind
  `ctx.hasUI`. A **manual check in a real terminal** (Ghostty/iTerm2, and inside tmux) is part of the bar.
- No ThinkRail assumptions: no `~/.thinkrail` paths, no host wire, no `@thinkrail/*` imports other than
  sibling portable packages.
- Gate: `bun run check:pi-packages` (`scripts/check-pi-packages.ts`, CI job `pi-packages`, provider-free).
  Packs the package and every pending portable workspace dependency, greps the tarball for Bun-only APIs,
  installs the tarballs plus pi at the catalog version into a temp agent dir **outside the repository**
  with pi's own npm policy (`--legacy-peer-deps`), configures `packages: ["npm:@thinkrail.ai/pi-<name>"]`,
  then copies `scripts/pi-package-parity.node.mjs` **into the fixture** and runs it under Node so pi
  resolves from the fixture (Node ignores `import.meta.resolve`'s parent URL — resolving from the script's
  own location silently tested the repo's pi). The runner loads through `DefaultResourceLoader.reload()`,
  asserts zero errors and the expected tools/skills, and executes a per-package case table (tool calls,
  expected text/error, and a `renderResult(...).render(width)` check). *Session-bound* tools (registered
  in `session_start`, e.g. subagents, background-commands) will need a mode that binds an isolated
  `AgentSession` on pi's faux provider — added with the first wave that ships one. Token-backed smokes
  stay on-demand.

## Release

`@changesets/cli` (catalog-pinned; `privatePackages: { version: false, tag: false }` so only this root is
ever versioned or tagged). A PR that changes a published package adds a changeset (`bun changeset`).
**Versioning is a human step**: a maintainer runs `bun run release:version` (`changeset version` +
`bun install`) on a branch and opens an ordinary PR — JetBrains' org policy forbids Actions from creating
PRs, and an ordinary PR also gets normal CI, which a bot-opened one would not. When that PR is on `main`,
`.github/workflows/release-pi-packages.yml` runs in the `npm-release` environment with `id-token: write`:
re-runs the parity gate, then `bun run release:publish` (`scripts/publish-pi-packages.ts`), which exits
early while any changeset is still pending (versions not bumped yet) and otherwise publishes
**dependencies before dependents**, each package whose version is not yet on npm: `bun pm pack`
(rewrites `workspace:*`/`catalog:` to exact versions, satisfying Decision 10) → `npm publish <tgz>
--provenance --access public` under npm Trusted Publishing (Bun has no OIDC auth; npm ≥ 11.5.1) →
`changeset tag` + push only when the script reports `readyToTag=true`: no pending changesets, not a dry
run, and every current public version is on npm (published now or earlier, e.g. by the manual
bootstrap). An early exit therefore never tags the placeholder `0.0.0`, and `changeset tag`'s skip of
existing tags makes a retry after a failed tag push safe.

Trusted Publishing is configured per *existing* package, so each new package gets one manual bootstrap
publish first: `bun run release:pack <dir>` packs it and prints the `npm publish … --provenance=false`
command for an npm-org owner (the manifest's `publishConfig.provenance` would otherwise make a local
publish fail; only CI can attest).

Order: visualize → delegation + subagents → background-commands → spec-graph → todos. Not published:
`pi-thinkrail-workflow` (workspace-internal), `pi-dag` (until it has a consumer).

## Boundary

- **Allowed deps:** pi SDK peers, sibling `pi-extensions/*`, ordinary npm runtime deps declared exactly.
- **Forbidden:** `@thinkrail/*` host packages, `packages/server`, `apps/*`, `thinkrail-extensions/*`.
- Dependency edges between siblings (e.g. subagents → delegation) are listed here when they exist:
  `subagents → delegation`, `dag → delegation`.

## Members

| package | shape | notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `visualize` | extension | `visualize` tool; `lovely-mermaid` for TUI box-drawing and the best-effort vanilla validation; exports `createVisualizeExtension({ validateMermaid })` so an embedder can inject a strict validator. Detail: [[module-pi-visualize]]. |
