# ThinkRail

[![JetBrains incubator project](https://jb.gg/badges/incubator-plastic.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub)

A ThinkRail-branded desktop-and-mobile client for the [`pi`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent)
coding agent. ThinkRail is a thin host that runs `pi` in-process and bridges it to a rich, mobile-first
UI — `pi` owns models, skills, compaction, cost, and session state; the app owns the workspace, the
editor, and the wire.

**Website:** [thinkrail.ai](https://thinkrail.ai/) — a landing page that *is* the IDE, its blog,
and the [vibecoder-focused experience](https://thinkrail.ai/vibecoding/) (see
[`apps/website`](apps/website)).

**ThinkRail is a Worktree IDE:** open a git repo as a project, spin up workspaces as `git worktree`s (each its
own branch and cwd), and work across a tabbed Monaco editor, git Changes view, terminals, a read-only
spec-graph viewer, and multiple concurrent `pi` chat sessions — all scoped to the active worktree.

## Install

ThinkRail ships in two additive forms: a native desktop installer and the self-contained `thinkrail`
CLI, which opens the same app in your browser. Both embed the same in-process agent host and are
published with `SHA256SUMS` on the [releases page](https://github.com/JetBrains/thinkrail/releases).

JetBrains signs the Windows CLI and desktop setup executable. The macOS CLI is signed but not yet
notarized. Signed/notarized desktop DMGs require the coordinated JetBrains service pipeline; older
published DMGs and local Electrobun packages may still be unsigned and blocked by Gatekeeper. Linux
artifacts are unsigned. Local installer smoke is not notarization verification.

### Desktop

Download the matching `thinkrail-desktop-*` asset: a DMG for macOS Apple Silicon, a setup ZIP for Windows
x64, or a setup tarball for Linux x64/ARM64. Extract the complete Windows ZIP before running its setup
executable, keeping its adjacent payload; extract the Linux tarball and run `installer`. Electrobun 2.0.1
does not provide a macOS Intel desktop build. The coordinated macOS release pipeline uses Electrobun's
expanded app archive for JetBrains signing and SRE DMG finalization; that intermediate archive is not a
public download. The signing limitation above remains until that private pipeline update is deployed.

Linux desktop builds require Ubuntu 24.04 or another glibc 2.38+ distribution with GTK 3, WebKitGTK 4.1,
Ayatana AppIndicator 3, and librsvg 2. On Ubuntu 24.04:

```bash
sudo apt install libgtk-3-0 libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0 libayatana-appindicator3-1 librsvg2-2
```

Eligible packaged stable and nightly desktop builds check for updates in the background. An update follows the
classic consent-driven flow in **Settings → Updates**: **Download** → **Downloading** → **Preparing update** →
**Install & Restart**. Closing Settings or quitting normally defers it; only **Install & Restart** applies the
prepared release. The updater appears only when the package carries a valid HTTPS feed identity. Existing
installations that predate that identity need one manual installation before in-app updates are available.

### CLI / browser

The CLI installer downloads the right binary, verifies its SHA-256 checksum, and puts `thinkrail` on
your PATH.

**macOS / Linux** (also Windows under Git Bash):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JetBrains/thinkrail/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows** — the same command works from cmd and PowerShell:

```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JetBrains/thinkrail/main/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Nightly builds and pinned versions:

```bash
# macOS / Linux — a pinned version must belong to the selected channel
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JetBrains/thinkrail/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --channel nightly
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JetBrains/thinkrail/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --channel stable --version 0.1.2
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JetBrains/thinkrail/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --channel nightly --version 0.2.0-nightly.10
```

```powershell
# Windows — options are env vars (THINKRAIL_CHANNEL, THINKRAIL_VERSION, THINKRAIL_PREFIX, THINKRAIL_NO_MODIFY_PATH)
$env:THINKRAIL_CHANNEL='nightly'; irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JetBrains/thinkrail/main/install.ps1 | iex   # PowerShell
set "THINKRAIL_CHANNEL=stable" && set "THINKRAIL_VERSION=0.1.2" && powershell -c "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JetBrains/thinkrail/main/install.ps1 | iex"   # cmd
```

Then run `thinkrail` (add a git repo path to open it as a project: `thinkrail ~/code/my-repo`). Installed
stable/nightly CLI hosts periodically offer **Run Update** in **Settings → Updates**. That action runs the host
machine's parameterless `thinkrail update` in the background; the current host stays alive, and a successful
update asks you to restart it manually. This is also true when the UI is open in a browser on another machine.

You can run `thinkrail update` directly on any platform. It re-runs the installer for the installed channel and
replaces the current `<prefix>/bin/thinkrail[.exe]`; use `--channel` or `--version` only for an explicit terminal
override. To remove it, run `thinkrail uninstall`: it takes out the executable, the PATH entry the installer
added, and the install metadata, and asks whether to delete your `~/.thinkrail` app state (kept by default —
pass `--remove-data` to delete it, `-y` to skip the questions). `thinkrail --help` lists the flags;
`thinkrail --version` prints the build.

**Prebuilt platforms:** macOS (Apple Silicon), Linux arm64 + x64, Windows x64 (`.exe`). Intel macOS isn't
prebuilt — use Apple Silicon or build from source.

> Prefer a manual CLI install? Download a binary + `SHA256SUMS` from the releases page and verify the
> checksum. For safe self-update, rename it to `thinkrail` (`thinkrail.exe` on Windows) and place it at
> `<prefix>/bin/thinkrail[.exe]`. A binary kept under its release filename or another arbitrary location must
> be replaced manually or reinstalled with the script; it will not update a different hidden copy.

**Runtime prerequisites:** `git` on PATH, and an authenticated `pi` provider (the agent runs against your
real provider credentials). App state lives under `~/.thinkrail`.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites (developing ThinkRail)

- **Bun** 1.4.0 (the repository's pinned package manager and runtime)
- **Node.js** ≥ 22.19 (required by the in-process `pi` engine)
- An authenticated `pi` provider (the agent runs against your real provider credentials)

### For developers

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd thinkrail
bun install
bun run dev
```

`bun run dev` boots the host and the web client together. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop. Source/dev and locally
unstamped builds expose no Updates UI. Running `thinkrail update` from source installs a published binary; it
does not pull, install dependencies, or rebuild the checkout.

To run the launchers:

```bash
bun run --filter @thinkrail/cli dev  # browser launcher
bun run build:binary                 # standalone CLI artifact
bun run desktop:dev                  # package and open the Electrobun app
bun run desktop:build                # package without opening it
```

Desktop commands use the standard Electrobun CLI/configuration. Its pre-build hook builds the shared UI
and stages ThinkRail's PI/native resources; Electrobun owns preload bundling and installer creation.
Create host-native installers with `bun run desktop:package:stable` or `bun run desktop:package:canary`;
`canary` is Electrobun's internal name for the public **nightly** channel. Native/installer smoke and shared
CLI/desktop probes live in `packages/artifact-tests`, outside the
application packages. Run `bun run smoke:desktop` after a dev build; installer smoke takes an artifact
path and channel via `bun run smoke:desktop:installer <path> <stable|canary>`.

On-disk app state (projects, workspaces, worktrees) lives under `~/.thinkrail`.

## Architecture (three rings)

- **Engine host** — `packages/server` (+ `packages/shared`), launched by `apps/cli` or
  `apps/desktop`. `createServer()` is a `Bun.serve` HTTP+WS host with an `AgentSessionManager` (one
  in-process `pi` `AgentSession` per tab).
- **The wire** — `packages/contracts`: the typed, versioned protocol (types-only).
- **UI client** — `apps/web`: mobile-first React 19 + Zustand + Tailwind v4, ships independently and
  dials a host over the wire.

The engine is **`pi` only, run in-process** via `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`. `apps/web` depends on
`packages/contracts` only — never on the server — which is what makes the UI shippable on its own.

See [`goal-and-requirements.md`](goal-and-requirements.md) and [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) for
the canonical product and design specs.

## Development

Fast gates (also the husky pre-commit hook):

```bash
bun run lint        # biome
bun run typecheck   # tsc across all packages
bun run test        # unit tests (root tooling + each package)
```

End-to-end tests drive the real web UI against isolated hosts. The no-agent gate builds once and
uses a machine-adaptive number of independent shards (half the available CPUs, capped at eight):

```bash
bunx playwright install chromium                    # one-time
bun run e2e                                         # complete no-agent gate
bun run e2e -- e2e/changes.spec.ts                  # focused iteration
bun run e2e -- --last-failed                        # repair loop
bun run e2e:serial                                  # one-host debugging fallback
bun run e2e -- --shards=12                          # explicit 1–16 override
bun run e2e:binary                                  # packaged CLI host (build first)
bun run e2e:desktop                                 # packaged desktop host (build first)
bun run e2e:full                                    # everything; needs pi auth
bun run e2e:agent                                   # only @agent; remains serial
```

On macOS, every public browser E2E command prevents idle system sleep while its runner is alive; the
display may still sleep normally.

## Specification-driven development

ThinkRail is developed spec-first: hierarchical, interconnected specs live in the repo alongside the
code — top-level specs at the root (`goal-and-requirements.md`, `architecture.md`) and a co-located
`SPEC.md` for every module. When you change a boundary, contract, or decision, update the corresponding
spec in the same change. See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for the spec workflow.

## Analytics & Privacy

ThinkRail sends basic usage events to [PostHog EU](https://posthog.com): launches, chat creation,
accepted message sends, and provider connections. These are always on in desktop, CLI, and source runs;
a packaged desktop or binary build also attempts one first-install event per installation. CI and automated
tests are silent. Events include a random installation ID, version/channel, build kind, OS/architecture,
send mode, catalog-bucketed provider/model names, and the observed authentication category (API key,
subscription sign-in, OAuth, Central, or other/unknown)—never credential values or account/plan details.

Additional setup, run-outcome, task, review, and PR statistics follow an optional sharing preference.
The first-run dialog shows its switch on and saves that preference when it opens; additional events can
start before you press Done or dismiss the dialog. Switching it off saves that choice immediately. Done
or dismissal records completion of the dialog, not the start of delivery. Change the preference later in
**Settings → Privacy**. With website Marketing consent and optional sharing on in a packaged build,
ThinkRail may open its blog in your browser once and note which website link or campaign brought you there
(source, medium, campaign, content and a coarse referrer type; the link carries no URL or page). That note
enriches usage data for up to 30 days. `--no-analytics` or `THINKRAIL_NO_ANALYTICS=1` suppresses
additional events for that run only; basic reporting remains on.

Neither tier collects prompts, code, transcripts, file/repository names or paths, credentials, or token/cost
counts. The installation ID links usage over time, but no person profiles are created and GeoIP enrichment
is disabled. The [analytics spec](packages/server/src/analytics/SPEC.md) defines the event boundaries.
