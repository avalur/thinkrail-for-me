## Responsibility

Public PR gates, contribution templates, and reusable native build recipes. Release orchestration,
signing/notary credentials,
source authorization, tags, checksums, and publication belong to `JetBrains/thinkrail-signing`.
This module owns the public action inputs/outputs and artifact/version contract consumed by that private
pipeline.

## Boundary

- **Owns:** public CI/site workflows, contribution templates, native build recipes, version calculation,
  and the artifact
  interface consumed by the private release controller.
- **Consumes:** CLI and desktop build commands, [[module-artifact-tests]] smoke entrypoints, shared
  version stamping, root conformance/unit/browser commands, git, and native platform tools.
- **Forbidden:** product runtime logic; another public release controller; public signing credentials;
  publication before required signing and verification; checksums over pre-signing bytes; or a
  release-only application build path that bypasses normal package commands.

## CI

Workflow Bun setup reads the root `package.json` `packageManager` pin through `bun-version-file`.
Desktop's packaged runtime remains Electrobun-owned (see [[module-desktop]]).

PR and merge-queue gates cover dependency/boundary/seam/spec-surface conformance, lint/typecheck, unit
and no-agent browser tests. Linux and Windows run native CLI artifact smoke; Linux also runs browser tests
against the compiled binary. Desktop PR coverage builds the Linux target, runs native-window and shared
artifact probes under Xvfb with test-only software-rendering flags, and runs desktop-backed browser tests.
Real-provider tests remain explicitly authorized and separate.

A platform's native behavior is proven only on that platform. Windows remains a PR gate because its
executable, environment, path, and trash behavior differs materially from POSIX hosts. Its subprocess
unit gate also exercises native descendant-console behavior, which the Linux unit run cannot prove, and
its desktop window-chrome unit gate binds the `user32.dll` frame symbols the frameless title bar relies on
([[module-desktop]]); neither needs the Electrobun devkit. Native macOS and Linux ARM64 acceptance belongs
to the release matrix.

## Native build contract

The private native matrix checks out an explicit public source commit and invokes
`.github/actions/build-binary`. The action accepts `version`, `channel`, and a host-matching `target`.
Its stable public outputs are:

- `artifact-name` / `artifact-path` — native CLI;
- `desktop-artifact-name` / `desktop-artifact-path` — first-install desktop artifact;
- `desktop-app-archive-path` — Electrobun's expanded macOS app archive, empty on non-macOS targets;
- `desktop-update-manifest-path` / `desktop-update-archive-path` — Electrobun's updater metadata and
  full application archive, both non-empty on every desktop target.

The recipe stamps the shared version, builds and smokes the CLI, invokes the normal Electrobun dev and
channel builds, runs expanded-app and first-install smoke, then collects exact target/channel outputs.
Update outputs preserve Electrobun's generated basenames and compressed bytes. The manifest is the exact
`<stable|canary>-<macos|win|linux>-<arm64|x64>-update.json`. Its `artifact.file` is the archive basename:
`stable-<platform>-ThinkRail[.app].tar.zst` for stable or
`canary-<platform>-ThinkRail-canary[.app].tar.zst` for nightly, where `<platform>` is the manifest's
OS-architecture pair and `.app` occurs only on macOS. Collection resolves both names for the requested
channel and target rather than accepting the first glob match. The paths point directly
into Electrobun's output tree; updater payloads do not change the installer-only dist aliases. On macOS the
update archive may be the same expanded-app archive exposed through `desktop-app-archive-path`; the recipe
does not duplicate or repackage it. [[module-artifact-tests]] owns isolated packaging-invocation and
collector contract tests; this module owns the action and delivery contract.

Supported desktop assets:

| Target | Native runner | Published asset |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bun-darwin-arm64` | `macos-14` | `thinkrail-desktop-darwin-arm64.dmg` |
| `bun-windows-x64` | `windows-latest` | `thinkrail-desktop-windows-x64.zip` |
| `bun-linux-x64` | `ubuntu-24.04` | `thinkrail-desktop-linux-x64.tar.gz` |
| `bun-linux-arm64` | `ubuntu-24.04-arm` | `thinkrail-desktop-linux-arm64.tar.gz` |

Windows and Linux aliases name untouched framework installers. The Windows ZIP contains its setup
executable and adjacent payload; Linux's tarball contains the installer and README. For macOS, the
private SRE flow replaces the unsigned framework DMG with a conventional DMG containing the signed
expanded app, under the same published alias. The app archive is a private signing intermediate, never
a public release asset.

On Windows, the packaging invocation puts System32 first so Hutch's bare `tar` resolves to Windows
bsdtar; Git's GNU tar interprets drive-letter paths as remote `host:path` operands. The collector resolves
exact framework filenames. Stable installers omit the `stable-` prefix; nightly
uses Electrobun's `canary` prefix/suffix. Full updater archives and metadata are handed to the private
pipeline under their raw framework names; patch generation remains disabled. Electrobun 2.0.1 has no
macOS x64 core. Linux requires Ubuntu 24.04+/glibc 2.38 and the declared GTK, WebKitGTK,
AppIndicator, and librsvg dependencies. CEF and additional installer formats are outside this contract.

## Release identity and trust

The release controller supplies an explicit public `source_sha`. The public recipe stamps only
`packages/shared/src/version.ts` with `{ version, channel, commit }`; CLI, desktop configuration,
analytics, and `server.welcome.appVersion` consume that same identity. The private workflow's own commit
is never product identity.

Signing credentials and access to `codesign.labs.jb.gg` stay in the protected private pipeline. Hosted
native jobs receive no service credentials; protected internal jobs perform service calls but do not
build product source or assemble archives. CodeSign and checksum actions are private and versioned with
the release workflow.

The pipeline fails closed: it builds every target, signs and verifies the required artifacts, computes
checksums over final bytes, authorizes the source commit against public main, creates an idempotent tag,
and only then publishes. Intermediate artifacts never enter the public release. An explicit unsigned
allowlist admits only the Linux artifacts; any new platform or unexpected file blocks publication until
its signing policy is decided.

## Signing and notarization

Windows signing covers the CLI and setup stub; the hash-keyed adjacent payload remains byte-identical.
The macOS CLI keeps its independent Developer ID signing path.

Desktop macOS signing consumes Electrobun's expanded `.app.tar.zst`, because Hutch writes final version
metadata after `postBuild` and compresses the inner app before `postWrap`. Hosted macOS prepares native
transfers; protected internal jobs sign every Mach-O file, seal the completed app ZIP, and notarize it in
a distinct operation. Hosted macOS staples the app ticket and creates the DMG. Protected jobs separately
sign, notarize, and staple that DMG.

Publication requires native macOS verification of the app and container: JetBrains signing identity,
hardened runtime, Bun entitlements, strict signature checks, Gatekeeper assessment, notarization tickets,
and first-install smoke. Signing and notarization are distinct service operations and retain explicit
content types. Entitlement extraction requests XML before plist parsing.

## Desktop updater qualification and publication

Auto-update scope includes every current native desktop target in the matrix above. Canary qualification
precedes stable; each target needs an observed installed-version A to version B upgrade before enablement.
The public build handoff now includes the raw Electrobun manifest and full archive; the private runtime feed
and publication automation are not yet live. Runtime policy belongs to [[module-desktop]].

The private pipeline consumes those raw names, finalizes the macOS application through the existing signing
flow, and creates its update archive from those final bytes. It assigns each finalized archive an immutable,
version-qualified protocol-compatible basename and changes only `artifact.file` in the corresponding
framework manifest before publication. Other manifest identity fields remain framework-generated. Payloads
are uploaded and made publicly retrievable before their channel manifests. This updater handoff adds no new
signing, notarization, verification, or publication gate; the existing platform requirements remain in force.

Native update acceptance is **manual-first**. It uses finalized release bytes in disposable installations,
records both versions and per-target results, and covers check-stops-at-available, explicit download, distinct
transfer/preparation, deferral by closing Settings, **Install & Restart**, channel isolation, interrupted
transfer/retry, post-update version/host health, and restoration of local state. Running agents and terminal
commands are not expected to survive host restart. Windows qualification uses a disposable VM/runner because
installation integrates beyond HOME. Relevant checks repeat when
Electrobun, packaging, signing or restart handling changes. This limits investment in a broad new updater
suite for an infrequently changing integration; it does not remove existing signing, artifact-smoke, fast
or complete no-agent browser gates. New automated coverage stays narrow around application-owned lifecycle
regressions and the existing public artifact-output contract tests; no dedicated updater CI matrix is required.

## CLI installation and other automation

Root `install.sh` and `install.ps1` remain CLI-only consumers: validate channel/version identity, resolve the
requested release, validate its tag against the selected channel's exact grammar before constructing any
artifact URL, download the native CLI plus `SHA256SUMS`, verify it, and stage replacement in the
destination directory before an atomic rename. Prefix checks are representation-based rather than ASCII-only:
Unicode and benign `@`/`+` components remain valid, while each platform rejects characters that would corrupt
metadata or startup-shell syntax. Git Bash writes native-readable Windows metadata; malformed shell PATH blocks
are preserved rather than rewritten. CLI self-update binds metadata to the running executable and invokes these
installers rather than duplicating download/checksum logic. Controlled script tests own these
regressions; finalized Windows PowerShell/Git-Bash and custom-volume behavior remains release qualification.

Website deployment contains no signing credentials. CODEOWNERS and the main-branch rules protect the
public recipes; local builds and public PR jobs never publish user-facing release artifacts.
